<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>The writers of the present volume have a purely practical
object in view. They have no desire to discuss,
theoretically, the duties, rights, and responsibilities of
women. They consider that it would be unwise to give
prominence to considerations affecting the political or
social position of women, in a work dealing specially with
their industrial situation.</p>

<p>On the other hand, they are fully aware that there
is a necessary connection between the views which appear
to be in course of formation as to the proper position of
women in the labour market, and the change which has
taken place in the standpoint from which all questions&mdash;even
the most abstract&mdash;regarding the condition of women
are now discussed. Various reforms have been forced on
us within the last thirty years through the necessity of
recognising, legally and socially, that development in the
relations of women to the state and to society which has
been brought about by the pressure of the altered circumstances
of modern life. Unfortunately, the agitation
which has accompanied the carrying of these reforms has
been characterized, in some directions, by a deplorable
lack of self-control and judgment on the part of certain of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
those who have put themselves forward as the leaders of
their sex. In the past, it must be confessed that our social
system has not afforded to the majority of women those
opportunities for the acquisition of disciplined habits of
mind which are to be found only in bearing the responsibilities
of independent action and self-government. When
we hear the voices of those who have been called the
“shrieking sisterhood” uplifted in frenzied violence against
the male oppressor, when we are tempted to repudiate their
follies, we may remember that crimes against good sense,
good taste, and good feeling are, like other crimes, bred of
the bitter resentment of wrong which springs in the breasts
of all who awake to consciousness of the suffering inflicted
by centuries of unjust rule. This being so, we may see
some extenuation even of the ravings of those unhappy
“wild women” who appear to hold the most serious
national interests as of no importance, in comparison with
the fascinating amusement of fostering an unwholesome
antagonism of sex.</p>

<p>The clamour raised by those who have taken this line of
extreme reaction has retarded the advance of public
opinion in the direction of practical and needed reform,
and has gravely hampered the efforts of those who have
striven to arouse public interest in the attempt to better
the position of women in various fields of labour. People
have, not unnaturally, been alarmed by what seems to
many the absurd suggestion of equality between the sexes,
and, shrinking from the assertion of such principles, have
adopted an attitude of hostility to the just claims of women<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
for consideration in respect of their labour and wages,
their education, the protection of their earnings and
property, the removal of such trade and professional
restrictions as are of an artificial character, and the
opening out to them of wider means of obtaining a
livelihood.</p>

<p>In view of the responsibilities and duties which society
now imposes on women, changes in the direction of these
reforms are not only reasonable but necessary in the
common interest. To insist, however, that such reforms
shall under no circumstances take account of the
differences of sex is to fight against indisputable facts
which must, in the end, prove too strong for us. There is
no danger to society in the recognition of equal human
rights for both sexes, if we are also ready to recognise the
divergence of their capabilities, for the relations of men
and women to each other, their functions in the family
and the state, must ultimately be determined&mdash;however ill
it may please the more ardent female reformer&mdash;by the
operation of natural laws.</p>

<p>If we attempt to ignore these laws we are at once
landed in a sea of difficulties. Take this very question of
“Women’s Work.” At the outset we are brought face to
face with facts that show us that all employments are not
equally suitable to men and women. We find that, in the
case of mothers at least, there are many occupations for
which they are wholly unfit, but in which men may engage
with impunity. Day after day we find child-bearing women
compelled to labour after a fashion for which they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
temporarily unfit, and which is not only the frequent cause
of permanent injury to their own health, but entails a
heritage of disease, or of that feeble health which falls a
ready prey to disease, on all their offspring.</p>

<p>I have seen many married women who were habitually
employed in handling white lead, and in but two instances
has my question as to the health of their children been
satisfactorily answered; whilst in certain branches of the
potters’ trade the employment of the mother not unfrequently
means the death of her children in their early
infancy. Even where the employment is not in itself
unhealthy, its pursuit, regardless of the claims of the
family&mdash;as in the case where working mothers leave their
little ones at the gate of the factory to a stranger’s care&mdash;has
to be paid for by a high percentage of infant
mortality.</p>

<p>It is impossible to look into facts of this class without
realising that natural laws impose severe limitations, and
will probably continue to impose much the same restrictions,
as to health and strength on women workers; and
when these marry there arise ties which conflict, and, as far
as one can see, will always conflict, with the efficiency and
regularity of the labour of married women. The violation
of these restrictions on any large scale not only constitutes
a danger to the state by causing the steady deterioration of
a large section of the population, but the intermittent
character of the supply of labour from the ranks of
married women greatly heightens the difficulties with which
those who are concerned with the organisation of modern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
industry have to deal. It is indeed a commonplace now-a-days,
that without improved organization and regulation
of the labour of women there can be no security for the
majority of breadwinners.</p>

<p>The present state of anarchy in the labour world, and
the difficulties of our industrial situation, have been appreciably
heightened by the course of conduct pursued and
advised by those who persist in regarding the interests of
women as in themselves separate from the interests of men.
Colossal fortunes are built up in large measure by the
enforced labour of women and children, who are encouraged
in their suicidal rivalry with their husbands and fathers
in the labour market by those who do not realise the retribution
which follows on the adoption of their counsels.
I have used the word “enforced” advisedly; unchecked
competition is a force of great power. There are masses
of workers in England who are no more free to choose
their work, or to make terms for it, than were the slaves
on a Virginian plantation. The Newcastle woman in the
white lead works of Elswick, who counts seven little ones
at her board, whose man is out of work, is tied and bound
as with chains. Her man, her children, look to her for
food, and at her heels are hundreds of other women in
similar distress, whose breadwinners are, perhaps through
no fault of their own, also out of work, or in receipt of
wages wholly inadequate to the maintenance of the family.
Those who encourage our women to treat men as their
rivals, to compete with them, and by their competition to
persistently reduce the earnings of men, are doing their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
best to aggravate this state of things. The wages of the
husband and father being reduced by the entrance into
his trade of the women who undersell him, the wife and
mother needs must turn her back upon her home, and give
her working day to make up the difference. In this way
the homes of our working classes are too often destroyed,
and the health of future generations sacrificed.</p>

<p>Apart from the fact that, in most trades, women have
made their appearance on the scene in the capacity of
“blacklegs,” it must be admitted that there has been, on
the side of men, something like resentment at the intrusion
of women into professions or branches of industry which
have been hitherto reserved to themselves. The expression
by the men of this natural feeling&mdash;in the case
of the doctors it was something more&mdash;has, as naturally,
irritated the friends of those women who are seeking
fresh means of employment; it has enabled them to
appeal for sympathy and support from the public as against
the “injustice” of men, and it has strengthened their
determination to treat men, at all costs, as rivals and
enemies who must be driven from their occupations by
what I once heard one of these ladies describe, with more
force than elegance, as “the cheaper animal.”</p>

<p>To the onslaught of these shortsighted champions of the
working woman’s cause, the men, with equal unwisdom,
have retorted by raising, on every occasion, possible or
impossible, the plea of “unfitness” as a bar to the
treacherous encroachments of the opposite sex, and they
have thus, in their turn, tried to win popular sympathy with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
their efforts to prevent the entrance of women into certain
coveted employments, or to expel them from others in
which they have already gained a footing. “Unfit!” Yes,
undoubtedly, much labour at present performed by our
women is unfit, if there is any fitness in our old and
cherished ideal of home and of the place of the woman in
the family; but, if we once enter on the line of restricting
their employment by artificial barriers, it seems to me
difficult to foresee the number and variety of the complications
which would ensue.</p>

<p>We may, however, freely concede that some interference
may be necessary where, through the helplessness of the
employed and the unscrupulousness of the employer, the
health and well-being of future generations is jeopardised.
In other words, certain restrictions on the labour of
children and child-bearing women may be required by the
interests of that society of which they are a part; further
than this it seems scarcely wise to go in our demand for
anything like legislative interference in respect to this
matter of “unfitness.” The true remedy lies in the
direction of the better organisation of the trades themselves.
The same too may be said of the disastrous effect
on the market of that increasing supply of cheap labour
which is ever swelling to larger and larger proportions
through the influx of our women. Instead of encouraging
them to enter into competition with men, and by so
doing to drag wages down to lower and yet lower levels,
the task before us is to teach them that the interests of
labour are one, and that wherever they enter a trade they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
must in self-protection refuse to sell their labour for less
than a rate proportional to that demanded by their men.</p>

<p>Increased and effectual organisation would do away with
the causes which provoke that clamour for prohibitive
legislation which, as in the case of the pit-brow women,
calls forth angry protest from those who see their livelihood
endangered, and intensifies that bitter spirit of rivalry of
sex which is a fatal obstacle to the better and harmonious
ordering of the world of industry. The only safe course
for women, the only safe course for the community at large,
is to consider their industrial position as an essential part of
the general problem, not to be dissociated without risk from
the organisation of the men. The cardinal points of the
programme of the leaders of labour&mdash;the shortening of
hours, the abolition of overtime, the regulation of wages,
the limitation of the number of apprentices in the overcrowded
trades&mdash;these are matters of chief importance to
all workers, matters in which the interests of all, whether
they be men or women, precisely coincide. Even where,
at first sight, their interests appear to diverge, it will on
further consideration be found that such sacrifice of
personal freedom as the woman may be, on certain points,
called upon to make, she makes for the sake ultimately of
her own hearth and of her own children. Those who
prefer to regard the interests of men and women as opposed
must accept a view of their mutual relations which, involving
as it does antagonism of sex, pits the woman
against the man in an unregulated competition for employment,
which, if forced to its extreme, will end by lowering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
the whole level of English life far more surely than the
immigration of any number of “destitute aliens.”</p>

<p>The difficulties which meet us therefore in adjusting the
relations of the sexes in the great field of labour are not
insuperable. Once our women workers see how much
depends on their co-operation, on their self-restraint, on
their standing firm, they will not fail their men, and the
difficulties which beset them and their position in the
labour movement of the day, once solved in the full light
of that which is best for the family, best for our society
and best for our national life, we shall assuredly be far
on our way towards the settlement of those less pressing
grievances which are put forward by the idle classes.
The highest interests of women in every sphere of life
are indissolubly bound up with those of men, and any
attempt to deal with either separately is fraught with danger
to the State and to the nation.</p>

<p>This principle lies at the bottom of all reasoned Trades
Unionism, which, in so far as it is concerned with the
organisation of women’s work, has for its ultimate object
the restoration of as many as possible to their post of
honour as queens of the hearth.</p>

</div>

<p>In dealing with the more cultured branches of women’s
work we have to do with a department which, except in one
or two directions, is as yet incomplete, being still in process
of growth and development. Women are but slowly
working their way into the arts and the learned professions,
and their place cannot yet be definitely estimated. Progress
has been so rapid of late that what is true one year has
ceased to hold good in the next. A writer who attempts to
deal with matter that is thus in a state of flux can only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
hope to give a tolerably faithful picture of the moment,
acknowledging frankly that present conditions may soon
give place to something very different. A counterbalancing
advantage, however, lies in the fact that in literary and
professional work women are independent units, and their
labour is not, as in manufacture and manual occupations,
so mixed up with that of men that it is almost impossible
to treat of it apart. In the occupations with which this
chapter is concerned each woman as a rule is economically
independent of other workers, and is free to make her
individual talent and idiosyncrasy fully felt. There is a
satisfaction in noting what women are able to do when their
hands are free, though a careful examination of the
conditions under which their work is carried on may lead
to the conclusion that circumstances are not yet as favourable
to the production of good work as they will eventually
become. It should be premised that work of any kind,
literary or other, is here regarded from a purely industrial
point of view, and that the aim of the writer is not to
criticise, but simply to record.</p>

<p>For practical purposes the occupations here treated of
may be classified thus:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>(1) Literary work, including journalism.</p>

<p>(2) Teaching.</p>

<p>(3) Other professional work, including medicine and
nursing.</p>

<p>(4) Art, including such handicrafts as are practised by
women; music, and the drama.</p>

</div>

<p>Various occupations not coming precisely under any of
these heads are followed by a few scattered individuals,
but these will receive merely a passing notice. They are
interesting in themselves, but are so largely experimental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
that it would be useless to consider them at any length,
since they may disappear at any moment.</p>

<p><b>Literature.</b>&mdash;It is only recently that women have
entered the field of literature in any numbers. Until the
last thirty years or so it may almost be said that only a few
exceptional women, able to make their mark as poets or
novelists, were occupied to any serious extent in literary
work. Nor when we remember that the pursuit of
literature was considered to “unsex” a woman, and that
Mrs. Somerville had to keep a supply of plain sewing ready
to cover her books and papers if a visitor should call, is the
deficiency very difficult to account for. Only natures in
which genius is a compelling force can burst such
iron bonds. Fanny Burney, Jane Austen, Miss Mitford,
Mrs. Somerville, Charlotte Bronté, and Mrs. Browning&mdash;to
name a few of the pioneers&mdash;first broke down the barriers.
Then other quiet workers crept in, magazines became more
numerous, and offered a ready outlet for literary work;
biography, history, and science began to be handled by
women. Harriet Martineau perhaps more than any other
woman typified the modern phase of literary activity,
fulfilling in her single person functions any one of which
would content most literary women, being novelist, essay
writer, historian, and journalist in one. She was the first
of her sex to enter upon the routine every-day work of
literature, which has been freely trodden since, and her
writings embody much of the tone of thought and feeling
which is characteristic of the “women’s movement” of
to-day.</p>

<p><b>Fiction.</b>&mdash;The branch of literature in which women
are most successful at present is undoubtedly fiction.
Besides the few novelists whose names are widely known,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
there are a multitude of scribblers of lesser fame who yet
make a good living by their profession. There are grades
in these things, and writers whose works are seldom found
on the shelves of the fastidious are yet in good demand
at the libraries, and have a circulation and a public of their
own. An immense amount of second class fiction is
written by women, who seem to have a special gift for
producing tales that are readable and brightly written without
ever rising above the level of mediocrity. There is
a still lower literary grade, in which poverty of invention
keeps company with a wretched literary style. Yet books
of this class are not always unsuccessful.</p>

<p>The writing of fiction is usually supposed to be a highly
remunerative occupation, and so indeed it often is. But
it does not follow that the writing of three volume novels
pays. The phenomenal success, pecuniary and literary, of
one or two recent novels must not be taken as a sample of
what a writer may expect.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Though a good price is generally
paid for a novel if the author has once hit the public taste,
only moderate terms can be secured by less known writers,
and beginners must be content to part with their works
for a very small sum. A well-known novelist may receive
£400, £500, or even more for a novel, but a writer of fair
reputation does not as a rule receive more than £100 for a
novel that may have taken many months to write. If the
novelist is wise, however, she will make a varied use of her
material. Good prices, say from £100 to £250, are given
for serial stories by publishing syndicates, who issue the
tale simultaneously in half-a-dozen newspapers; and the
regular publishers do not as a rule give any less for novels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
which have already appeared in the serial form. Probably
they regard the earlier issue as a good advertisement. Short
tales also pay well to those who can write them, and by
the contribution of occasional miscellaneous papers to
magazines and reviews the strain of prolonged composition
may be avoided and the income proportionately improved.
A lady novelist and miscellaneous writer in London has
been making from £600 to £700 a year for some time,
and has lately made as much as £900. Just at present
the acknowledged author has an advantage even in
journalism, for there is a great demand for articles in
newspapers signed by writers of repute. As much as
£10 a column is sometimes received for articles not
in themselves of an important character by writers whose
names are well known in other fields. It is an expensive
fancy, and whether it will last cannot yet be predicted;
but if one paper indulges in it, the rest are obliged
to follow suit. Outside fiction, a good deal of miscellaneous
literary work is done by women, of which it is
impossible to give any detailed account. Each writer
works in her own fashion, and for lack of meeting-places
there has hitherto been little interchange of thought or
experience among literary women. The foundation of the
Writers’ Club in London may perhaps be taken as a sign of
change in these matters. The formation of this institution is
instructive, since it was due to the limitation of the projected
“Authors’ Club” to men, on the express ground (endorsed
by Mr. Walter Besant) that women writers could not afford
to pay the subscription. In support of this opinion a lady
engaged in literary work in London estimates that few of
the rank and file among her colleagues are earning more
than £200 a year. On the other hand, some writers have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
made a competency for old age, and not a few married
women, hard pressed by fate, have contrived to bring up a
family upon their literary earnings. Miss Annie S. Swan
recently owned to an income of about £1,000 a year, and
Miss Yonge made a handsome fortune by her novels.
Successful playwrights also make a good deal of money;
but it is doubtful whether any woman comes under this
category as yet.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> George Eliot received £8,000 for <i>Middlemarch</i>, but Mrs.
Humphry Ward is said to have received £18,000 for <i>David Grieve</i>.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Journalism.</b>&mdash;At the present moment journalism
appears to be the fashionable literary pursuit for women,
and their contributions to the daily and weekly papers have
increased enormously during the last few years. The
general lightening of the cargo which has taken place
throughout the periodical press has greatly contributed to
this result; for women writers have usually a light touch,
and an apparently inexhaustible power of turning out
bright and readable, though often flimsy, articles upon
social subjects. In the department of dress they of course
reign supreme, and few newspapers can now afford to
despise this erstwhile frivolous subject. The writers who
discourse upon fashion, however, have, as a rule, had little
literary training; and through their efforts a kind of press
jargon has been evolved, wonderful alike in grammar, in
phraseology, in similes. But this is the least creditable
form of feminine journalism, and we will not linger over it.
In many of the papers written for women (and to which,
of course, women largely contribute) there is very fair
writing upon a great variety of subjects. Women have
occasionally been successful in the main walks of journalism,
but the position of the lady who represents the
<i>Daily News</i> in Paris is probably unique. As a rule women
keep to their special department, chronicling the doings of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
London society, and taking charge of the lighter topics
generally, while their <i>confrères</i> are dealing with politics and
diplomacy.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> This new development of journalism affords
an example of the results which may be expected to follow
when women are allowed free play to their activities in
other directions. They will not always simply duplicate
the work of their male predecessors, but will enlarge the
field of operations by striking out a line of their own.</p>

<p>It is impossible to name with any accuracy the income
attainable in the profession. Few of the women whose
names are known in connection with the press are journalists
pure and simple, though some of the younger generation
are adopting the profession in all frankness, to sink or
swim as their luck allows. Some few who entered the
field before there were many competitors have achieved a
good position, but their number could easily be counted on
the fingers. A woman, however, who has a fair variety of
subjects at command, and can combine purely literary work
with the day-to-day business of a journalist, may make a
very reasonable income from her profession&mdash;say £400 a
year. But a journalist beginning at the bottom of the
ladder would take long to mount so high, and would
probably be well content, after some years’ work, to be
earning £200 a year. It should be noted that journalism
among women is almost confined to London; for though
there are women so engaged in the provinces, it seldom
forms their regular means of livelihood.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2" id="Footnote_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> Miss Flora Shaw, who writes upon Colonial subjects in the <i>Times</i>
may be mentioned as an exception.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Teaching.</b>&mdash;The profession most commonly followed
by educated women is of course that of teaching. Until
recently it was almost the only occupation open to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
class above shop assistants, and even in becoming a
teacher a lady was held to have lost caste. The opening
of university education to women has given the death blow
to such false sentiment, and women are now free to adopt
what calling they like without loss of social position.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
The foundation of public day-schools for girls and the
working of the Education Act of 1870 have diverted the
channel of women’s activities from private teaching to
public schools. Instead of the governess we have the High
School mistress; instead of the “Dame” in a cottage the
Elementary School teacher. Not that the private governess
is in any way abolished, for many parents prefer, or are
obliged by reason of residence in the country to have their
children taught at home. Both the governess’s status and
salary are, however, considerably improved, owing to the
rise in the general level of education. Greater acquirements
are demanded, and payment is higher in return. A
resident governess may earn anything from £20 to £200
a year with board. If not resident she hardly obtains the
full equivalent in money, since her board costs her
employer but little if she lives in the house, and is
generally left out of consideration. But for many reasons
resident posts are unattractive to the majority of teachers,
and a bribe in the way of higher salary has to be offered if
a really competent teacher is desired in a boarding school
or a private family. Young women entering the profession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
generally prefer posts in High Schools, where the work,
though fatiguing, is kept within fixed hours, and where
time out of school is (nominally at any rate) at the teacher’s
own disposal. There is something stimulating in teaching
large classes, and those who have grown accustomed to it
are seldom content afterwards to devote themselves
to one or two children. Payment too is regular, and
employment tolerably certain, whereas in private families
either means or honesty or both may be defective, and
in any case the growth of the children deprives the
governess sooner or later of her employment. For these
reasons therefore High Schools as a rule attract the ablest
teachers, unless delicate health or personal predilection
happens to weigh in the other direction. A similar state
of things prevails with regard to private schools, which are
obliged either to pay high salaries in order to attract good
teachers, or to put up with the inefficient ones who cannot
easily obtain work in a High School.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_3" id="Footnote_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> The early students of Girton and Newnham, however, were
regarded askance. One of them, now in a position of honour, related
that when her intention of going to college became known in the
country district where she lived, her acquaintance “could not have
spoken worse of her if she had committed a forgery.” To another who
had gained a scholarship her friends remarked, “You are surely satisfied
now, you cannot want to <i>make use of it</i>.”</p>

</div>

<p><b>High Schools.</b>&mdash;It is doubtful, however, whether High
School work altogether deserves the respect with which it is
regarded by aspirants to the teaching profession. A
glamour was thrown around it in the beginning by the
interest with which the foundation of new schools was
regarded, and there is a certain sense of distinction in
forming part of an institution whose working always attracts
a good deal of local attention. Against these attractions,
however, must be set decided disadvantages. In the first
place the work is very severe, and it is made harder than it
need be by the bad methods of teachers. To impart to
large classes the stimulus which is the essence of good
teaching is no light task, and the better it is performed the
more is taken out of the teacher. But as the actual class<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
hours are usually short (9 to 1, and 2.30 to 4 on three or four
afternoons in the week according to arrangement) this alone
would not be found injurious; and where the staff is as
large as it ought to be, teachers should get an interval
during some at least of the mornings. But the worst part
of High School work is the correction of homework, which
in many cases takes up most of the evenings in the week.
Such an expenditure of energy is almost pure waste, and
the mistress comes to school in the mornings tired and
dull, incapable of exerting the magnetism which makes the
lesson a living thing. It is greatly to the discredit of head
mistresses that a greater number of them do not set their
faces against this practice. Instead of consulting with
their assistants as to how corrections can be minimised, they
often insist upon a certain amount of homework being set,
and seem to consider that the more of it a teacher does the
greater is her value. In reality the opposite is the case, for
a good teacher will test her class during the lesson, and thus
do away to a great extent with the necessity for homework.
Homework cannot be altogether abolished, but it might and
ought to be much diminished, in the interests of both
teachers and taught. Women need to be less rigidly
conscientious in these matters, and more truly enlightened.</p>

<p><b>Salaries.</b>&mdash;The salaries to be earned by assistant
mistresses in High Schools can hardly be regarded as
satisfactory, though they are probably higher than anything
that could be gained by teaching, except in a few cases,
before the institution of public day schools for girls. A
committee of ladies and gentlemen interested in education
recently investigated this question with great care, and a
summary of their conclusions may be given here. In the
first place they estimate that a change from private teaching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
to a High School is “mostly attended by pecuniary loss,”
which confirms the statement made above. After analysing
the replies to schedules of questions sent out to schools,
the committee come regretfully to the conclusion that, apart
from head mistresses’ and a few exceptional posts, “something
under £160 per annum is the average reward, after
twelve or thirteen years’ experience, of the most expensively
educated and successful assistant mistresses.” From my
own knowledge of High Schools I can fully endorse this
estimate. Few assistants earn more than £150 a year, and
there are probably&mdash;nay, certainly&mdash;not half a dozen who
receive £200 a year. As the reward of an expensive
education, and, presumably, a fair amount of talent, these
figures can hardly be regarded as satisfactory.</p>

<p>Summing up the general results, “We may say,” proceeds
the report, “that of the teachers who joined their present
school more than two years ago one-fourth are at present
receiving an average salary of £82 for an average week’s
work (the average including very large variations) of 32
hours; half (25 per cent. of whom possess University
degrees) are receiving an average salary of £118 for a
week’s work of about 35 hours; and one-fourth (50 per cent.
of whom are University women) are earning an average of
£160 in exchange for a week’s work of 36 to 37 hours.</p>

<p>“These results do not appear unsatisfactory, but it must
be remembered that under the phrase <i>more than two years</i>
is covered a length of service extending in one case to as
many as seventeen years, and of which the average must be
taken as very nearly six. Many also of these teachers have
had considerable experience in other schools before entering
the one in which they are at present engaged.”</p>

<p>A further question which the Committee were charged to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
investigate was the decline or otherwise of school salaries.
Upon this point they remark, “The schools which have
been in existence for some years appear to be paying within
a trifle of what they paid in 1885, but among the few
returns which the Committee have been able to obtain
from teachers in the employment of the recently formed
Church schools, are some salaries so low as appreciably to
affect the general average.</p>

<p>“The Committee, however, are obliged to note&mdash;and they
do so with the greatest regret&mdash;that whereas between three
or four years ago the commonest initial salary of non-graduates
was fluctuating between £70 and £80, the
preponderance has now been decisively gained by the
lower figure.”</p>

<p>This real though slight retrograde movement in salaries
is reinforced by another factor, of which intending teachers
should take note.</p>

<p>“Until recently,” reports the Committee, “when a new
assistant-mistress was engaged in a High School, the agreement
then made arranged not only for an initial salary, but
also for a scale of annual or biennial increment up to a
certain maximum. The Committee learn with regret that in
many schools these agreements are no longer being made,
and that new mistresses are therefore obliged to trust for
the future entirely to the liberality of their councils.”</p>

<p>It will be seen therefore that the position of a High
School mistress, though fairly stable and moderately well
remunerated as women’s occupations go, does not present a
brilliant prospect. Additional risk arises from the recent
establishment of schools, some of which belong to the
Church Schools Company, others to local companies, with
lower fees than those prevailing in the average High School.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
These tend by their competition for pupils to reduce the
profits of the better schools, and therefore to lower teachers’
salaries. The evil is a serious one, and it is much to be
regretted that women, by accepting posts in such schools,
should countenance a movement fraught with injury to
their fellow-workers.</p>

<p>It is exceedingly doubtful whether the public schools for
girls which have sprung up all over the country with such
rapidity of late years have been formed upon a sound footing
as regards payment of fees and salaries.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Broadly speaking,
the fees are too low to pay salaries which will allow the
recipients to live in any but a very careful manner. If
unhampered by claims of relations, teachers may secure the
necessaries, and, to some extent, the comforts of life; but
they can hardly allow themselves such recreation, change
of scene, and general liberality of living, in the wide sense
of the term, as will enable them to recuperate their stock
of health, energy, and intellectual brightness, so as to retain
freshness in teaching and keep abreast of the times. The
right level of teaching cannot be maintained upon any less
terms; and so long as girls’ secondary schools are founded
upon a purely commercial basis, the standard which we have
a right to demand from those who have charge of the
education given therein will seldom, I fear, be reached.
The organisation of secondary schools is, however, too
large a matter to be discussed here. The whole question,
including the claims of secondary schools upon the State<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
for support, is rapidly becoming an affair for national consideration.
Legislation cannot be long deferred, and the
preliminary stage of discussion and debate has already begun.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_4" id="Footnote_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> The average fee in the Girls’ Public Day School Company’s

no dividends to pay, and is backed by the richest Corporation in the
world.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Elementary Schools.</b>&mdash;The conditions under which
employment can be obtained in the elementary schools
may be found in the official publications of the Education
Department, and the general character of the work is also
too well known to need description here.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> More women
than men are employed in the elementary schools, the

the denominations to which the schools belong. It should
be noted that the tables refer to certificated mistresses only.</p>

<p>These tables show a considerable difference between the
salaries paid in Board and in Voluntary Schools, the Board
School average being £91 3<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i> against the highest
Voluntary average of £69 14<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> In rural districts also
extra duties of an onerous nature, such as teaching in the
Sunday-school, playing the organ in church, getting up
village concerts, and performing parochial duties generally,
are often imposed by the clerical managers of Voluntary
Schools. Small School Boards also are not wholly guiltless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
in the matter. Particulars as to these exactions may be
learnt from the publications of the National Union of
Teachers, which is making a determined stand against
their imposition.</p>

<p>The highest salaries are given by the London School
Board. Trained assistants (female) begin at £85 a year,
and head mistresses receive from £200 to £300. Higher
salaries are given for special work, and in the large
provincial centres also it may be said without inaccuracy
that the regulation scale is constantly broken in order to
secure good teachers of special subjects. In London
pupil teachers’ schools the salaries of assistant mistresses
begin at £125 a year, rising by annual increments of £5
to £150. Assistant masters in similar posts receive £140
to £170 per annum. Salaries for both sexes are said to
be rising gradually throughout the country, and although a
contrary movement has recently been initiated in the
London School Board, it is hardly likely that it will be
carried out to any great extent.</p>

<p><b>Elementary <i>versus</i> Secondary Schools.</b>&mdash;Hitherto
elementary schools have not commended themselves
as a field of work for the class of women who now
form the staff of girls’ secondary schools. The salaries
offered outside London have not been high enough to
tempt them; holidays are short in comparison with High
Schools (six weeks in the year instead of thirteen); and,
lastly, the conditions as to training hitherto exacted have
been practically prohibitive. Women who have already
received an expensive education are not inclined to spend
two or three years more in a denominational training college.
The relaxation of rules in favour of women who have
passed certain recognised examinations, and the opening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
of day training classes in connection with recognised
colleges, such as Owen’s College, Manchester, and several
of the local University Colleges, may do much to open the
elementary schools to a more cultured class of women.
Such women would soon obtain the headship of a school,
and would then, under a liberal Board, find a good
field for the exercise of talent and organising power. I
fear, however, that the shortness of holidays may still
prove a serious obstacle.</p>

<p><b>Domestic Subjects.</b>&mdash;Meanwhile a new field of
work is being opened by the inclusion of domestic
subjects in the school course. A teacher of cookery in
elementary schools can earn from £80 to £100 a year in
a fairly agreeable manner, and private and visiting teachers
often earn more. Dressmaking and laundry work are also
in great demand, particularly in evening continuation
schools; and if to these subjects is added a knowledge of
sick-nursing and elementary hygiene, the combination
forms an admirable stock-in-trade for a teacher. In some
towns School Boards are training their own teachers,
probably with more haste than thoroughness, to fill the
posts for which such a sudden demand has arisen. Instruction
in domestic subjects is also being carried on
under the auspices of the County Councils, for there are
few among their number that have not devoted a share of
the funds available under the Technical Instruction Act,
and in towns by the power of levying a penny rate, to the
furtherance of technical education, in which domestic
instruction for girls is almost always included. Thus,
throughout the length and breadth of the land, teachers
of these subjects are eagerly sought; and cookery schools,
embryo technical schools for women, and voluntary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
agencies, such as the National Health Society, are busily
employed in training teachers and sending them out to
different districts. The Liverpool School of Cookery is
particularly active in this direction.</p>

<p>The misfortune is that in these subjects there is no
definite standard, and each school trains after its own
fashion. The money for technical education was gained
by a side wind, and the passing of the Act found the
country unprepared, no organised system of instruction or
of training for teachers being in existence. As experience
is gradually accumulated the different agencies at work will
probably make comparison of methods and adopt to some
extent a common system and standard. In this connection
it should be mentioned that though women have no place
upon County Councils, they may be and are appointed
upon the local committees for carrying out the Councils’
schemes, and in this way they are able to take an active
share in educational work.</p>

<p>It cannot at present be foretold what shape this large
enterprise will eventually take, but it seems likely that for
some time to come the teaching of domestic subjects will
form an important and considerable opening for women.
It is fortunate that it is so, since many are thereby enabled
to find congenial employment who have no taste for the
purely literary side of education. In time permanent
institutions for domestic instruction will probably be formed
in the large centres of population&mdash;indeed such a movement
has already begun. The superintendence of work at these
centres, which will also embrace outlying districts, must
give rise to good appointments, and it is well to bear in
mind that these will certainly fall by preference to women
who besides technical knowledge have received a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
general education, and possess powers of organisation and
management. Women so qualified will probably be highly
paid. The rank and file may not impossibly find their
earnings diminish as their numbers increase; at present
their services are at a scarcity value. In view of the
certain extension of this branch of teaching work it is
worth while for girls or their parents to consider whether
(viewed as a wage-earning instrument solely) a course at a
school of domestic economy, requiring at most two years,
and costing a comparatively small sum (say £15 per
annum), is not more advantageous than three or four years
at Oxford or Cambridge, costing from £70 to £100 a year.
In the ordinary branches of teaching, as I have shown, a
woman seldom earns more than £150 a year, and teaching
is almost the only breadwinning occupation followed by
women graduates. I know teachers of domestic economy
who make as much or more in the winter months, and have
the summer free for either rest or self-culture.</p>

<p><b>Higher Teaching Posts.</b>&mdash;But few posts of higher
teaching or superintendence are open to women. Even
those mentioned above are only just beginning to take
visible shape. Headships of High Schools are of course
important positions, and are often well paid. An initial
salary of £250 a year (sometimes, however, only £150) is
offered, generally with rooms, but not board; capitation
fees, varying from 10<i>s.</i> to 30<i>s.</i> are usually added, but
these do not begin until 100 pupils have been entered.
Thus in an unprosperous neighbourhood a mistress may
have all the trouble of organising and managing a
school for £150 or £200 a year; for it is precisely
in these districts that the lowest initial salaries are
offered. In some few cases the income rises to £700 or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
£800 a year. The headships of colleges and training
colleges available are of course very limited in number,
and the same may be said of the college lectureships at
Oxford and Cambridge, with rooms in college. These are
not well paid, and are chiefly attractive for the pleasant
university life they afford. Few women are as yet engaged
as University Extension lecturers, though it is hard to
see what impediment, beyond the prejudice of sex, stands
in the way of their employment.</p>

<p><b>Religion and Philanthropy.</b>&mdash;Religion and Philanthropy
have not hitherto been reckoned among the
avenues leading to remunerative employment for women;
but it is by no means certain that this will be the case
in the future. The Catholic Church has always provided
careers for women in connection with convents and sisterhoods,
and institutions formed upon their pattern are
springing up in the Church of England and even in the
Dissenting churches. Since, however, the members are
merely supplied with board, lodging, and clothing, and are
content to find their reward in the satisfaction of their
calling, there is little further to be said about these
occupations from the industrial point of view. The
feminine side of religious and philanthropic work, however,
is developing upon much broader lines than heretofore,
and though at present it partakes largely of the
character of amateur work, it can hardly fail in course
of time to create remunerative and (if the term may be
allowed) professional occupations for women. To some
extent this is the case already. Even in the Established
Church the propriety of women preaching appears to be
regarded to some extent as an open question, and&mdash;with
or without formal sanction&mdash;the innovation seems destined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
to spread. Whatever else women preachers may lack they
at any rate seldom fail of a congregation, an item which no
church can afford to disregard. It can hardly be doubted
that in this field also the labourer will eventually be found
worthy of her hire. For example, philanthropic societies
have usually a paid secretary, besides, in many cases,
visitors, lecturers, and propagandists. Most of the religious
bodies have now “Settlements” in the London slums, with
women’s branches. The resident manager is certainly paid
in some instances, and will no doubt soon be in all.
Political work may also in time afford occupation to a
limited number of women. It is, however, in purely religious
work that we may expect to see the next development of
women’s activities. In almost all denominations women are
already at work preaching and exhorting, and the desirability
of giving formal sanction to their proceedings is being
actively discussed in Nonconformist churches.</p>

<p><b>Law.</b>&mdash;Of the learned professions only one, that of
medicine, is open to women. A combination of law and
ancient custom keeps women out of the legal profession,
and it is only in certain of its approaches, such as
conveyancing and accountants’ work, that they are
free to seek a livelihood. A summary of the case
by Miss Eliza Orme <span class="smcapuc">LL.B.</span>, gives a clear idea of the
situation. “Women can make wills and simple agreements
without qualification. Anything else (<i>i.e.</i> deeds)
must be <i>nominally</i> done by a solicitor, and women can
only be employed by them as clerks. Women cannot go
into court. If they do chamber practice (<i>i.e.</i> settling
difficult deeds for solicitors, or giving counsel’s opinion),
they can only do it through barristers as ‘devils,’ receiving
half fees. If women are to be solicitors the Act<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
will need altering. To be barristers they must be
admitted by the benchers of one of the four Inns (Inner
and Middle Temple, Benchers’ Inn, and Gray’s Inn), and
if a woman applied, probably a joint council of all would
sit.</p>

<p>“The Benchers might admit them as certificated conveyancers,
which would not allow them to plead in court;
but men themselves have not used their certificate for
many years.</p>

<p>“The University of London law degree is open to
women. It is a thorough practical test, but not a legal
qualification to practice.”</p>

<p>From this summary it will be seen that the door of the
legal profession is still fast closed. There is no difficulty
however in a lady’s practising as a conveyancer, and no
reason therefore why more women should not follow the
example of Miss Orme in adopting the profession, which is
said to offer a fair prospect of remuneration. There is
also at least one lady accountant in London, and the
audit of societies and public companies, the preparation
of balance-sheets and financial statements, may be freely
undertaken by women who are willing to train for the
work.</p>

<p>It should be added that legal work seems likely to
become possible for women in India. Miss Cornelia
Sorabji, who recently passed in the law schools at Oxford,
is about to take up a Government appointment in her own
country, and will be occupied with attending to the legal
interests of Hindu women, who are unable to consult
lawyers of the opposite sex. It remains to be seen
whether her example is capable of being followed by
others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Medicine.</b>&mdash;The profession of medicine has at last,
after long struggles, been thrown open to both sexes, and
women doctors are slowly taking their place in the ranks as
recognised practitioners of the healing art. Their presence
will tend in an eminent degree to the preservation of health
as distinct from the cure of disease, at any rate as far as
women patients are concerned; since it is plain that women,
and especially girls, can be more readily induced to complain
of ailments in the initial and manageable stage if they
are able to consult a member of their own sex. This statement
is sometimes questioned, but as far as girls, at least,
are concerned, I have no doubt whatever of its correctness.
And since the seeds of illness are often laid in early life
this point is of the very greatest importance. It is not
necessary here to recall the history of the struggle for
medical education, or to give details as to the places of
study open to women.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> It is more important to enquire
what rank medical women are taking in their profession,
and what appointments they are able to obtain. Upon the
first point it is still too soon to pronounce an opinion. A
medical man does not expect to make a reputation within
the time that the majority of women have as yet been at
work. There are about 170 medical women upon the
register, and of these only a dozen qualified before 1880.
It is obviously too early, and the ground covered is too
small, to expect conspicuous results as yet; and if a number
of women are filling public posts in India, or working at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
private practice in England with adequate success, they and
their friends have every reason to be content. In some
respects it is said to be easier for women to build up a
practice than for men. Dr. Jex-Blake remarks that “in
point of fact women are continually doing what men hardly
ever attempt&mdash;viz., settling down in a strange place with no
professional introduction to practice by purchase or otherwise;
and if gifted with a moderate degree of patience, tact,
and other qualities needful in every successful practitioner,
they do manage to succeed in a way that certainly goes far
to justify their bold adventure.” It is usually estimated
that five years are necessary to put together a practice that
will afford a livelihood. Whether the standard of “livelihood”
here taken is as high as that of man cannot be
exactly known; but it is certain that women who succeed
in the medical profession make much larger incomes than
in most other callings.</p>

<p>The appointments which have recently become available
are a great help to medical women at the beginning of
their career. A medical man usually fills minor posts in
hospitals, or acts as a <i>locum tenens</i> for a while before
attempting to set up for himself; but women have hitherto
been obliged to take up practice as soon as their qualification
was gained. The New Hospital for Women in
Euston Road, officered entirely by women, now affords
young doctors the means of gaining experience, and a
number of other posts are gradually becoming available.
Several medical women hold Government appointments
as physicians to the female staff of the Post-office; a lady
officiates as assistant resident medical officer in a workhouse
hospital, another in the Holloway Sanatorium, others
in fever hospitals or as asylum inspectors. A well-known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
surgeon in the provinces employs a lady as an anæsthetist,
and a country doctor in good practice has for some time
been in the habit of employing medical women as assistants.
A few middle class girls’ schools have engaged the services
of a consulting lady doctor, and it would be well if the
example were more widely followed; since, apart from
cases of illness, there are many questions of hygiene
and school arrangements in which a properly-qualified
woman could give valuable advice.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_6" id="Footnote_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> For the former see Dr. Sophia Jex-Blake’s <i>Medical Women</i> and
(<i>inter alia</i>) a pamphlet entitled <i>Women and Medicine</i>, by Edith A.
Huntley (Lewes: Farncombe and Co., Printers); for the latter <i>The
Englishwoman’s Year Book</i>, which gives a list of medical schools
open to women.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Medical Women in India.</b>&mdash;An important field for
medical women is to be found in India. The Mahommedan
races do not allow the presence of a male physician
in the zenana; and the Hindus, who have borrowed from
the conquering race many of their ideas and customs, are
also opposed to the practice. The Countess of Dufferin’s
scheme for supplying medical aid to the women of India&mdash;now
too well known to require explanation&mdash;was instituted
in 1885, and has been warmly supported by native princes,
some of whom have founded hospitals on their own
account. At present thirteen women doctors are working
under the Dufferin Fund, besides assistant surgeons, and
over 200 pupils are studying in Indian medical schools.
The various missionary societies also educate and support
a number of medical missionaries in India. It
is possible that some day Government may include the
medical profession in the Civil Service, but for the
present the work has to be done by voluntary effort.
Eventually too Indian women will take over the medical
care of their own sisters; but for some time to come
the field must continue to be largely occupied by
Englishwomen. Hindu and Mahommedan girls do not
study medicine; the native students in medical schools<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
are drawn from the Parsees, Brahma Somaj (Veda Hindus),
and Eurasians. Englishwomen holding appointments in
India are allowed private practice as well, but the latter
alone would never yield a livelihood, since the natives
who make use of the dispensaries do not expect to pay a
fee. If they receive medicine they do not object to pay
for it, and those who send for a lady doctor to attend
them in their houses are also ready to pay for her services;
but only the comparatively rich think of asking for a
doctor’s visit. Ladies employed by the association engage
to work for five years in India, and, besides a free passage
out, receive a salary of 300 rupees a month. Scholarships
are attached to some of the women’s medical schools, but
the amount&mdash;£25 or £30 per annum during education&mdash;seems
very small in relation to the obligations undertaken,
which, if not fulfilled, involve the return of the money.</p>

<p><b>Pharmacy.</b>&mdash;One or two ladies have adopted pharmacy
as a profession; and as means of training are now
accessible, there seems no reason why an occupation
which is neither arduous nor disagreeable should not be
largely followed by women. Mrs. Clarke Keer has a
dispensary in London, and a few other ladies hold posts
in connection with hospitals. It has been suggested that
the work should be taken up by the daughters of medical
men, whose position gives them special opportunities for
training.</p>

<p><b>Dentistry.</b>&mdash;Another very suitable profession is dentistry,
which is largely followed by women in America, but
only by a few in this country. There should be excellent
openings in this profession. A dentist once observed to
me, that with children a woman dentist would have it all
her own way, and would probably beat all the men, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
children were troublesome patients, and men did not
know how to deal with them.</p>

<p><b>Midwifery.</b>&mdash;Women of education are being trained
in increasing numbers as midwives, and there is abundant
opening in this direction for useful and remunerative work.
But at present the status of midwives is uncertain, owing
to the lax regulations respecting their practice and qualifications.
The whole profession is undergoing a change,
passing from the ranks of untrained, unskilled, and inefficient
work to that of a skilled profession. The registration of
trained midwives is being urgently demanded, and a Select
Committee has reported in favour of the examination and
registration of all who practise as midwives. The necessity
for stricter regulations will be apparent when it is stated
that seven cases of childbirth out of ten in this country
take place without the presence of a medical man, and that
the women (mostly poor) who employ midwives have no
means of ascertaining their fitness for the duty. The
Obstetrical Society, London, gives a midwife’s certificate
of acknowledged value, which should be obtained by every
lady intending to practise in midwifery. For those who
wish to undertake benevolent work among the poor,
especially in country districts, a knowledge of midwifery is
highly desirable. The Midwives’ Institute in Buckingham
Street, Strand, looks after the interests of midwives, and
arranges for their training.</p>

<p><b>Nursing.</b>&mdash;The profession of nursing continues to
attract numbers of educated women into its ranks, and
facilities for training are said to be insufficient for the
demand. (For details see <i>Englishwoman’s Year Book</i>.)
Considering the hardships involved in the profession its
continued popularity is surprising. The work of a trained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
nurse, whether employed in a hospital or in private or
district work, is necessarily severe, and it is to be regretted
that more careful provision is not made for the comfort of
so useful a class of workers. Hours are long and holidays
short, and work of the most trying description is expected
to be done year after year, with a mere fraction of the rest
and recreation which is considered necessary in other and not
more arduous professions. In Nursing Institutes and Homes
the dietary is often very poor, and in hospitals the state of
things is not much better. It is unfortunately impossible
to repeat in any detail the complaints made by nurses
without indicating the institutions to which they refer; but
most persons with acquaintances among hospital nurses
know that abundant dissatisfaction exists in the profession.
Examples could of course be given of institutions that are
well managed in this respect, but they are, it is to be feared,
the exception rather than the rule. Boards of Management
are under constant pressure to increase their accommodation,
and, funds being seldom abundant, they are tempted to
work with an insufficient staff. The consequences are felt
most severely by the more educated nurses. It seems to
be forgotten that the superior tact and skill which make the
cultured woman a better nurse than her uneducated
colleague are gained to some extent at the expense of
toughness of fibre, and that hours and dietary need modification
accordingly. I am afraid that a good deal of the
mischief arises from mistaken notions as to what the
profession of nursing ought to be. Nurses are supposed to
take it up in a missionary spirit for the good of the
community, without regard to their own comfort or health.
Now unfortunately the more “noble” a profession is considered,
the greater is the tendency to neglect the material<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
well-being of those concerned in it; and nurses have
reason to feel the full force of this misplaced sentiment.
The policy followed in their regard is as foolish as it is
unjust. The inevitable fatigues of a nurse’s life require to
be counteracted by the most careful provisions for her
comfort, if full efficiency is to be kept up; and Hospital
Boards would do well to remember that more professions
are now open to women than there were when nursing
first became popular. The supply of capable nurses is
already insufficient, as the recent influenza epidemic showed,
and may easily become still more inadequate, if neither
facilities for training nor conditions of employment undergo
any improvement.</p>

<p><b>Nurses’ Salaries.</b>&mdash;Except in institutions to which
pensions are attached, the profession of nursing cannot be
regarded as a money-making career. At one large London
hospital probationers receive £12 with uniform the first
year, £20 the second, and the “sisters,” or heads of
wards, receive £40 per annum. The Workhouse Training
Association (for replacing pauper attendants by trained
nurses in workhouse infirmaries) gives no salary the
first year, £20 the second, rising to £25. A district
nursing association in the provinces gives trained nurses
£24 the first year, and salaries rise to £30&mdash;board, lodging,
and washing being also found. From £25 to £30
therefore generally represents the money payment of a
trained nurse. The matron of a hospital may receive
anything from £50 to £100 per annum. In the large
London hospitals the latter sum is often exceeded, with
the addition of house, servant, and handsome fees from
probationers. For heads of hospitals therefore the profession
is by no means unremunerative; but these posts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
are few and far between. With the multiplication of
cottage hospitals which is certain to take place minor
posts with fair salaries and a not too arduous life will
become available. Private nursing under a medical man
is often well paid, but uncertainty of employment has to
be taken into account. Co-operative associations of nurses
are also being formed, and it is possible that by their
means a larger proportion of the fees paid by patients
may find their way into the pockets of those who earn
them.</p>

<p><b>Art. Painting and Music.</b>&mdash;And now what must
be said of the domain of the arts and of women’s place
therein? If women have entered but timidly into this
fair kingdom, it has not been for want of fitness, as the
rapid success of a few among them clearly shows; the
hindrance has lain rather in the prejudices of society
and the lack of proper training. Though rapidly disappearing,
the former are not yet extinct; means of training
are not the same for both sexes, nor have women
ceased to suffer from the blasting influence of Puritanism
upon art. Anything that damages the social reputation of
a profession bars it more or less to women; and anything
that makes training difficult or expensive is a more serious
hindrance to women than to men, since parents are not so
willing to make sacrifices for a girl as for a boy. Astonishment
is often expressed at the absence of women composers
of merit; but the reason is not really far to seek.
Until the foundation of the London schools of music (to
which that of Manchester must now be added) musical
education has been difficult to obtain by either sex. But
the practical part, which involves an acquaintance with
orchestral instruments, the methods of opera, the arrangement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
of church music, the management of chorus parts
and a hundred other details, has hitherto been almost
unattainable by women. There seems little <i>à priori</i>
reason for supposing that music is an affair of sex. Fanny
Mendelssohn was scarcely, if at all, less gifted than the
brother who so calmly placed her in the background, and
was not ashamed to appropriate the credit of her work.
Some of the “Lieder ohne Worte,” and “O rest in the
Lord”&mdash;the latter perhaps the most popular of all Mendelssohn’s
melodies&mdash;were, as is now generally known,
composed by Fanny.</p>

<p><b>Remuneration.</b>&mdash;It is impossible to give any estimate
of the value of either music or painting as a means of livelihood.
A music teacher, if well qualified, may earn a fair
living; and a teacher of an instrument less commonly learnt
than the piano&mdash;say the violin&mdash;may sometimes earn £150
or £200 a year while quite young. Singers, unless of the
first rank, generally find it profitable to combine private
teaching with public performances. For a concert engagement
a beginner may receive £5 with travelling expenses,
rising soon, if successful, to £10 or £20. Great performers
are of course at a “monopoly value,” as the economists
say, and their annual earnings often run into four figures.
As for composing, its pecuniary reward is very uncertain.
“It does not pay to write symphonies,” a popular composer
naively remarked, and the same thing may be said of most
of the higher kinds of composition. Incidental music for
stage plays is often well paid, and a popular song may yield
a small income in itself. The budding composer, however,
like the artist or author, must be content to let his first
works be sold for almost nothing for the sake of making a
reputation, but this once made he can command his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
terms. A deadening effect is exercised on musical art in
this country by the mischievous system of royalties. Many
singers high in the ranks will not look at a modern song
unless they are paid a handsome royalty for singing it, and
thus a valuable means of advancing the reputation of a
young composer is rendered useless.</p>

<p>Painting and sculpture are so purely an affair of the
individual that it is more difficult to make general statements
with regard to them than with any other artistic
profession. Each artist works on his own lines; there is
no general or usual rate of remuneration, and no one can
predict with any certainty the prospects of the profession
even to a painter of talent. Indeed the less the talent,
often, the greater the success. All that can be said is that
the woman who means to live by her brush or her chisel
must be prepared for a hard struggle before she can earn a
competence; and very few attain to wealth. The development
of illustration in periodicals has however opened a
large and fairly-well paid outlet for women’s work, and
many a rising painter would be hard put to it but for the
aid that comes&mdash;only in guineas and half-guineas it may be,
but steadily&mdash;from black-and-white drawings for the press.
Many men, though at present few women, earn a fairly
good living entirely by black-and-white work.</p>

<p><b>The Stage.</b>&mdash;The stage is, socially speaking, becoming
easier of entry for girls. Those who wish to succeed
must begin young, a proviso which forms a serious disadvantage
in a profession involving obstacles to be surmounted,
or awkward corners to be rounded. It is
difficult to obtain entrance to a good London theatre,
and novices generally have to go through a course of probation
with a touring company, with the prospect of hard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
work, ill quarters, and uncertain pay. The profession is
thus encountered on its roughest side at first, and it is not
surprising that the prospect should daunt intending candidates.
Yet the stage has a fascination of its own, and
those who once tread the boards can seldom find it in their
heart to forsake them. If a girl can by luck or perseverance
gain a footing in one of the good London companies, the
life need present no terrors to herself or her friends, and
payment will be fair and regular while it lasts; but outside
a comparatively small circle the stage, though perfectly
reputable, is at best precarious as a means of livelihood.
Engagement is almost always for the run of a single piece
only, and there is usually no payment for rehearsals. Thus,
after weeks of rehearsal, if the piece is unsuccessful, a girl
may only earn a fortnight’s salary. In these matters actors
and actresses are not well used, and when they have learnt
the value of united effort they will certainly combine for
securing juster terms. There is less cause for complaint in
the <i>rate</i> of payment, which is generally fair, and often very
good; while a successful actress can of course make a very
large income. In good theatres a guinea a week is a common
wage for a girl who merely “walks on,” but with touring
companies she is generally expected to serve an apprenticeship
before earning anything. If she obtains a speaking
part she may earn £2 or £3 a week; but an actress would
do well to reckon her salary at half its nominal amount, as
she is likely to be frequently out of work. The institution
of regular rates of payment is hindered by stage-struck
amateurs, who are willing to pay, in some cases large
sums, to appear on the boards, even in the smallest
capacity.</p>

<p>There are all ranks and grades in the dramatic profession,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
and a vast number of actresses never rise above the position
of “extra” ladies in pageant plays, or the rank and file of
performers in pantomimes. The latter earn from 15<i>s.</i> to
20<i>s.</i> a week, and their employment is intermittent. In the
case of impecunious or unscrupulous managers payment
also is uncertain. Girls in the humbler ranks of the
profession are subject to all sorts of ill-treatment and
swindling. For example, a number of girls were recently
engaged for an “open-air fête” in the country during
some weeks of the summer. The weather turned out wet,
and a friend who visited them found their dressing-tent
only partly covered in, and swimming in water. They
had attended thirteen rehearsals and a few performances
without payment, and but for the intervention of friendly
outsiders it is doubtful whether they would ever have
received any payment at all. These girls had left paying
employment as dressmakers and milliners for this thankless
work, yet they endured their unjust treatment without
complaint.</p>

<p>Speaking generally, the difficulty of the dramatic profession
is, that while talent is rare, it is overcrowded with
candidates of very moderate abilities. On this account it
is very difficult for a girl to get an opportunity of showing
what she can do, and much patience is necessary to success.
If possible, a girl should have some other means of eking
out her income during the first months or years of the
struggle.</p>

<p>Many girls work at dressmaking in the summer
months, taking to the stage regularly when the pantomime
season comes on. Then there is the ballet, which in
London alone employs thousands of women. An ordinary
ballet dancer receives £1 to £1 10<i>s.</i> a week, and has to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
work hard for her money; the best members of the troupe
however may earn as much as 35<i>s.</i> a week. The earnings
of “solo” dancers are of course much higher. English
principals in pantomimes receive £5 and £9 a week, but
the usual custom is to employ foreigners&mdash;French or
Italians&mdash;who are paid as much as £12 a week. Popular
performers receive fancy salaries, and a dancer or music-hall
singer who has hit the public taste sometimes makes
as much as £70 a week. A lady in this branch of the
profession was recently invited to visit America at a salary
of £250 a week. A “variety artist” sued her manager for
£43 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> as a week’s salary, and gained all but the odd
£3 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> Miss Loie Fuller, the “serpentine” dancer, was
engaged, as a subsequent lawsuit shewed, by a French
manager for three years, at a salary of 102,000 francs, or
over £4000 a year. If reward went by talent and artistic
culture these figures would be highly satisfactory, but as a
rule the reverse is the case. With regard to dancing, however,
public taste is improving, and both on the stage and
in private houses graceful dancing&mdash;dancing worthy of
being called an art&mdash;is increasingly appreciated. A really
good dancer is highly paid, though not upon the extravagant
scale quoted above.</p>

<p><b>Handicrafts.</b>&mdash;A word must be said about the
position of women in artistic crafts and in designing,
though it is to be feared that the account will somewhat
resemble the famous chapter on “Reptiles in Ireland.”
Pottery is almost the only field in which women are
employed as designers, and here, as in isolated examples in
other trades, what has happened is rather that an artist has
turned trade designer, than that the trade has educated an
artist. For example, a lady now carrying on business as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
jeweller was educated at an art school, and owing to some
accidental circumstance began designing for a jeweller.
Eventually she set up in business for herself, and still
designs many of the articles manufactured in her workshop.
Isolated cases of the same kind might be cited from other
trades. Speaking generally, however, women designers
have not shaken themselves free from the trammels of the
art schools, or gained the practical acquaintance with crafts
and manufacture which alone can make their work marketable.
It is probably more difficult for women than for
men to gain this practical knowledge, and those who mean
to succeed must bring both courage and perseverance to
the task.</p>

<p><b>Artistic Crafts.</b>&mdash;The artistic crafts proper are hardly
followed at all by women. With the decay of domestic
industries they lost what skill and knowledge they once
possessed, and technical education has not yet restored
them to their rightful position as skilled workers. If
women are employed as jewellers, potters, or even photographers,
it is only in the least skilled, and consequently
worst paid portions of the work. Thus in the jewellery
manufacture they are employed in unskilled operations,
such as stringing pearls; and their earnings do not rise
above £1 a week, while the skilled labour of men
brings in from £3 to £6 a week. At electrotyping, in
Birmingham, their wages are not more than 25<i>s.</i> a week,
and the same might be said of those engaged in the
electro-plate manufacture in Sheffield.</p>

<p>A few women are employed in chromo-lithography, but
not many lithographers are willing to take women as
apprentices. Wood engraving employs rather larger
numbers, and the work is fairly well paid. In an office<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
in which four women engravers work the wages earned per
head during three months were, on an average, £2 18<i>s.</i> 5<i>d.</i>
weekly, the highest wage earned being £3 3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>, and the
lowest £2 13<i>s.</i> 7<i>d.</i>, representing a payment of 1<i>s.</i> 1<i>d.</i> an
hour. At another office the average weekly wage is
£1 18<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i>, the highest being £2 3<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i>, and the lowest
£1 7<i>s.</i> 11<i>d.</i>, representing an average payment of 10<i>d.</i> an
hour. The entrance of women into such crafts has been
materially aided by the Society for the Employment of
Women, in Berners Street, which endeavours to find both
means of training and business openings for its clients.
In artistic crafts which require an apprenticeship women
have much opposition to encounter; their entrance is
generally opposed by the workmen employed, who fear,
and not without reason, that the women will undersell
them and bring their wages down. If women hope to
gain a footing in skilled occupations they must conciliate
opposition, by showing that they have no intention of
underselling their fellow workmen.</p>

<p><b>General Conclusions.</b>&mdash;It will be seen that in
almost all the occupations here considered women have
special difficulties to contend with&mdash;imperfect training,
amateurish habits, social customs or prejudices, and the
opposition of those who, sometimes from prejudice and
sometimes from a well-grounded fear of injury, oppose the
industrial employment of women. Time and good
counsels may be trusted to diminish these obstacles, if not
to do away with them entirely. Meanwhile it remains
to give women the opportunity, by thorough training, of
showing the extent of their capacity for different kinds of
work. Disquisitions as to what women can do, or cannot
do, are irrelevant at the present moment, when facilities for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
training and employment have not been open long
enough to test their powers in any direction. In these
matters it is safer to prophesy after the event, and it
is certain that competition will eventually drive women
out of any calling for which they prove themselves really
unfitted.</p>

<p><b>Routine Clerical Work. Type-writing.</b>&mdash;There
has been a great increase of late in the variety of routine
clerical work open to women. The type-writing machine
might have been designed for their especial benefit, since it
has brought within their reach a number of occupations
well suited to their capacities. The lady typist and shorthand
writer is a recognised institution in American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
commercial houses; American women, with their superior
adroitness, having promptly seized upon an opening so
favourable to their interests and adapted it to their own
use. The difficulty as to the two sexes working together is
not as much felt in America as here, and where special
arrangements have to be made or accommodation provided
for women clerks it is done without demur. For type-writing
to be satisfactory as an occupation it should be
combined with shorthand, for a typist pure and simple can
seldom rise beyond a clerkship in a type-writing office, and
must not expect more than clerk’s pay; and in this case
her weekly wages will certainly be counted by shillings,
not by pounds. The addition of shorthand renders many
kinds of secretarial work available, and here, as in other
occupations, any special skill or knowledge may lead to a
considerable increase in wages. An industrious typist
who can secure a good connection may make a fair, though
not a large, income by working on her own account.
Authors and journalists often dictate their work to a shorthand
writer and typist, receiving it back in a few hours in
a handy and legible form. The usual fee is from 2<i>s.</i> to
3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> an hour. Doctors, literary and public men, often
give permanent employment to a typist, and this kind of
work is specially suited to women. Here again, however,
brains as well as manual skill are needed. Mere routine
work can never earn more than low wages.</p>

<p><b>Clerks and Book-keepers.</b>&mdash;Female clerks and
book-keepers are largely employed in retail houses of
business. To judge from their rapidly increasing numbers
it would seem as if their work were quite as satisfactory as
that of men, and yet their wages are invariably lower.
Herein, it is to be feared, lies the only difference between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
them and the male clerks whom they supersede. From 15<i>s.</i>
to £1 a week is probably as much as a woman can expect
in this employment; but, on the other hand, a girl with an
aptitude for business may sometimes make a clerkship the
stepping-stone to a forewoman or manager’s post, thus
leading, of course, to much higher wages. A well-known
shipping firm in Liverpool has for many years employed a
lady to take charge of all the ship linen and furniture.
Under her is a large staff of clerks and needlewomen, who
carry on their work in comfortable and well-arranged
premises not far from the Docks. It is probable that as
women come to receive a more practical and thorough
education they will be more largely employed in posts in
which care and attention to small details is important. At
present the capacity which women undoubtedly possess in
this direction is often neutralised by slovenly business
habits.</p>

<p><b>The Civil Service.</b>&mdash;Of clerkships those in connection
with the Civil Service are perhaps the most
important. From the eagerness with which women
compete for its posts, indeed, the Civil Service would
seem to be a very El Dorado for its employés, a
conclusion which is hardly warranted by an examination
of its conditions. The work, however, is light, demands
only moderate abilities, and is performed on the whole under
agreeable conditions. Wages are not high, but pensions
are attached to the most important branches, an advantage
which hardly any other employment open to women
possesses. A woman who has worked for forty years in
the Post-office may retire with a pension equal to two-thirds
of her salary. Even after ten years of service a pension
of one-sixth is available. The respective amounts, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
case of Post-office clerkships (to be described immediately),
would probably be about £80 and £15 per annum
respectively, and a woman must be earning exceptional
wages in any other employment to put by sufficient to
bring in an income of even these modest dimensions. It
is unfortunate that in this, as in so many other occupations,
women are willing to undersell men. The clerks in the
Post-office naturally look with anything but favour upon
the influx of women clerks at a lower wage, knowing that
it means their own gradual supercession. It is sometimes
said that the less robust health of women, and their
consequently less regular attendance, forms sufficient
justification for a lower rate of pay; but the alacrity of
the public departments to engage female clerks seems to
shew that any disabilities on the score of health are more
than balanced by diminished salaries. Where the advantages
to the employer are equal there is seldom any
eagerness to prefer the labour of women. A similar
displacement of men is going on in other Government
departments; at the War Office, in Special Commissions,
and elsewhere, women are being engaged for routine
clerical work, and almost always at a lower rate of payment
than men.</p>

<p><b>The Post-office.</b>&mdash;The most important public
department with regard to the employment of women is
the Post-office. The Postmaster-General’s Report for 1891
shows the total number of officials on the permanent
establishment, with sub-postmasters and letter receivers, to
be 63,868, of whom 8877 are women. Of these, 906
women are employed as clerks in the chief offices in
London, Edinburgh, and Dublin, and 3750 as “counter-women”
and telegraphists throughout the kingdom, besides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
others employed as sub-postmistresses and letter receivers.
These figures however do not represent the gross total of
the Post-office staff, for we are informed that about 54,000
other persons are employed more or less in Post-office work,
and of these 16,000 are women. In this estimate are
probably included the extra clerks, generally former <i>employés</i>,
who come in and help at times of special pressure, as
well as the domestic servants and needlewomen whose
business it is to keep the buildings and miscellaneous
Post-office property in order.</p>

<p><b>Classification.</b>&mdash;An impression prevails that women
are only employed by the Post-office in selling stamps and
sending off telegrams, that being the only branch of Post-office
work of which the general public has cognisance.
“Counter-women,” however, as these <i>employés</i> are technically
called, are only subordinate officials, and their work is both
less agreeable and worse paid than that of some of the
other departments. Post-office appointments, as far as
women are concerned, may be classified thus:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>(1) Clerkships in the four great branches of the
Post-office&mdash;the Savings Bank, Postal Orders,
Returned Letters, and Clearing House.</p>

<p>(2) Sorterships.</p>

<p>(3) Telegraph Learnerships.</p>

<p>(4) Counter-women and telegraphists.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Clerkships.</b>&mdash;Of the posts just enumerated the clerkships
are the most important and best paid, and are
filled by a superior class of women. During some years
they were obtained by nomination, and the women chosen
generally came from the cultured classes; but now all
appointments are thrown open to competition, and anyone
within the limits of age (18 to 20) who can pass the not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
very severe entrance examination is eligible for a vacancy.
There is considerable demand for these posts, and it is
considered a very small competition if there are only two
qualified candidates for every vacancy. The hours of
attendance in the office are in most cases seven daily, and
a month’s holiday is allowed. Salaries commence at £65
a year, rising by an annual increase of £3 to £80 in the
lowest class. There are possibilities however of much
higher salaries, as the accompanying table (drawn from the
<i>Civil Service Competitor</i>) of numbers and salaries of the
female staff at the General Post-office, London, shows&mdash;</p>

<p><b>General Conditions.</b>&mdash;Work in the General Post
Office is carried on under pleasant conditions. The
premises are good, and all reasonable arrangements are
made for the comfort of the clerks. Strict privacy is enforced;
the clerks never come in contact with the public;
and, the routine of the business once mastered, there is a
regularity and freedom from worry about Post-office work,
which to certain natures is probably attractive. A girl of
fair education, but without the special knowledge or aptitude
necessary for the teaching profession, may profitably turn
her attention to Post-office work, in which the defect of
monotony is counterbalanced by regularity of employment
and the prospect of a pension in later life. Candidates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
must be unmarried or widows, and must be duly qualified
in respect of character and health. They must further pass
an examination in handwriting, spelling, arithmetic, English
composition, geography, and English history. A periodical
entitled the <i>Civil Service Competitor</i> gives details as to the
changes which take place in the regulations from time to
time.</p>

<p><b>Sorterships.</b>&mdash;These posts are attached chiefly to the
General Post Office in London. Candidates must be “not
less than four feet ten inches in height without boots” (a
very moderate requirement, surely), and the limit of age is
15 to 18. An examination must be passed in reading and
copying badly-written manuscript, handwriting, spelling,
arithmetic (first four rules), and the geography of the
United Kingdom. Salaries begin at 12<i>s.</i> a week, rising by
1<i>s.</i> a week to 20<i>s.</i>, with prospect of promotion to the higher
classes. The work chiefly consists, as the title indicates, in
sorting the papers of the department. Like the clerkships
just described, the occupation is regular and not disagreeable.
An advantage in a young girl’s beginning as a sorter
is that if she desires to qualify for a clerkship, she may, if
she has served for two years, secure an extension of age up
to 25. Thus, though she fail to pass the examination at
the latest age allowable to outsiders, she may try again,
perhaps several times.</p>

<p><b>Telegraph Learnerships.</b>&mdash;The privilege just mentioned
is attached to this department also, and appointments
as counter-women are now usually filled up from the ranks
of the telegraph learners. A preliminary examination must be
passed in dictation, handwriting, and arithmetic (first four
rules), and successful candidates must attend a Post-office
Telegraph School (free) to learn the craft. The course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
usually takes three months, but pupils who show no aptitude
may be discharged. On receiving a certificate from the
school the telegraphist begins work in a Post-office at a
salary of 10<i>s.</i> a week, rising to 12<i>s.</i> and 14<i>s.</i>, as she becomes
capable of transmitting messages and taking charge of an
instrument; thence, if promoted, to 30<i>s.</i> or 38<i>s.</i> Supervisors
may receive from £90 a year to £140. The age for admission
in London is 14 to 18, in the provinces 14 to 25.</p>

<p><b>Counter-women.</b>&mdash;This is the only branch of Post-office
work which is carried on under the eyes of the
general public, the workers serving at the open counters of
Post-offices, selling stamps, cashing postal orders, and
performing all the miscellaneous duties belonging to a
local office. Since the Government took over the
management of telegraphs counter-women have been of
necessity chiefly recruited from the telegraph learners. A
second-class counter-woman receives from 12<i>s.</i> to 30<i>s.</i> a
week; a first-class from 30<i>s.</i> to 38<i>s.</i></p>

<p><b>Complaints against Women.</b>&mdash;It must be acknowledged
that women have not altogether distinguished themselves
in this branch of employment. Sir James Fergusson,
when Postmaster-General, felt called upon to issue a circular
to Post-office clerks, with pointed reference to the female
clerks, recommending the practice of greater civility in
their dealings with the public; and the measure was
regarded, I think, with general satisfaction. In some
commercial centres similar complaints are made of the
indifference and carelessness of the girls in charge of
the telephones, who do not seem to realise that important
business transactions are dependent upon their
promptitude and attention. In a large telephone office
which I could name women have been replaced by men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
to the unconcealed satisfaction of the subscribers. A
newspaper editor told me that he always found a great
change for the better when evening arrived, and women
clerks were replaced by men. It would be easy to make
too much of these complaints, but they deserve to be noted
in considering the entry of women into new employments.</p>

<p><b>Commerce.</b>&mdash;Leaving clerical work on one side, we
may now turn to the wide field of trade and commerce,
and examine into the position occupied by women.
Here, as in most other departments, their place will
be found to be chiefly subordinate. Women rarely
enter the higher and more lucrative branches of
trade and commerce, while they overcrowd the lower
ranks. Isolated cases may be quoted in which the control
of large capital is in the hands of women; and as land-owners
and managers of large estates they often take
an important share in commercial operations. We sometimes
hear of women millowners and merchants; but
these positions are generally the result of accident rather
than choice, and women who have become capitalists by
inheritance seldom (except in the case of land) take any
active share in the management of their property. There
are exceptions, however; and it is possible that if a careful
enquiry were made they would prove to be more numerous
than was supposed. In a recent lawsuit about a colliery
the defendant, a lady coalowner, was asked, “You never
go down into the mine, I suppose?” “Indeed I do,”
was the reply. “I take the greatest interest in my property,
and I frequently go down into the mine.”</p>

<p>Englishwomen lag strangely behind American and
French women in the conduct of business enterprise,
though whether from lack of talent or opportunity is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
clear. Probably they possess neither the talent of the
French nor the opportunity of the Americans. In retail
trading women take a much larger part, though here their
operations, if on any large scale, are generally confined
to one or two trades, chiefly those concerned with
women’s dress and outfitting. Probably no great number
of women are engaged in these enterprises, but in the
smaller kinds of shopkeeping they are largely concerned.
Very precarious much of this work is. Any decent woman
who has saved a little money thinks herself qualified to
open a shop and carry on business without preliminary
training. The usual result of such experiments is that
capital dwindles away before profits have begun to make
their appearance. Women do not always realise that the
management of even a small business requires knowledge,
resource, and an unwearied attention to details.</p>

<p><b>Trade as a Career.</b>&mdash;It is to be regretted that the
daughters of shopkeepers, particularly of the wealthier
sort, do not more often devote themselves to trade. Their
position gives them unrivalled opportunities of learning
the business under agreeable conditions, and they would
gain thereby an independent position and an occupation of
great interest. As forewoman, cashier, buyer, or manager
of a department, a girl of superior education with an
interest in the well-being of the concern might do good
service for the firm. The majority of wealthy shopkeepers’
daughters however usually prefer to dissociate themselves
as far as possible from the industry which is the source of
their prosperity, while pushing their way into society by its
aid. <i>En révanche</i> ladies of the aristocracy, secure of social
position, but lacking in means, have recently taken to retail
trade; and though not all the aristocratic millinery and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
dressmaking establishments started a few years ago with
a flourish of trumpets have outlived the difficulties of early
life, the fact that the attempt has been made has contributed
a good deal to change the attitude of society towards retail
trading as an occupation for women. A few thoughtful
parents, perceiving that such occupations as High School
teaching offer but a poor reward for the energies of cultivated
women, are training their daughters systematically for
trade. The wisdom of such a course deserves to be highly
commended, for girls so prepared will enter upon their
work with every chance of success, and free from the
ignorance which perpetually clogs the steps of women’s
enterprise. To parents not themselves in business the
matter may present some difficulties; but for girls whose
fathers are in trade, the means of training are of course
ready to hand. They will do well to get rid, as speedily as
may be, of the false sentiment which makes them despise
a pleasant and lucrative employment.</p>

<p><b>Shop Assistants.</b>&mdash;When we come to the lower grades
of employment, to the work of shop assistants and book-keepers,
the proportion quickly alters, and the women far
outnumber the men. There are unfortunately no means of
ascertaining the number of women so employed, but the
total number of both sexes in the retail trade is about one
million, and about four-fifths of the assistants in the drapery
trade are women. In other trades the proportion is not quite
so high, and in the grocery trade about nine-tenths are men.
An account of the labour of men and women in shops (for
the two sexes cannot be separated in its consideration)
must, if truthfully given, be little else than a recital of their
grievances. There are, it is true, establishments where the
<i>employés</i> are well paid and fairly treated, but their number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
is small compared to those in which poor pay, ungenerous
treatment, and unhealthy surroundings are the lot of the
shop assistant of either sex.</p>

<p><b>Their Grievances.</b>&mdash;The chief points upon which
complaints centre are:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>(1) Capricious deductions from wages.</p>

<p>(2) Unfair forms of agreement.</p>

<p>(3) Long hours.</p>

<p>(4) Insanitary surroundings.</p>

<p>(5) Living in.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Wages.</b>&mdash;First as to wages. We often hear it said that
a young woman serving in a shop is better paid than a
governess; and it is true that a young woman of business
ability and good appearance engaged as show-woman in a
millinery or mantle department can earn from £200 to
£300 or even £400 a year&mdash;far more than women
teachers, except in rare cases, can dream of earning. But
these are the plums of the profession, and they are few and
far between. The wages of shop assistants are exceedingly
variable, small shopkeepers only giving a few shillings a
week, the proprietors of large establishments being able
to afford a better wage. In the larger shops an entrance
premium is often demanded, or at least the assistant must
serve for several months without wages. Women assistants,
for no apparent reason, receive considerably lower wages
than men. The former may earn from £10 to £25 a
year with board and lodging, the latter from £20 to £40.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
Generally speaking the wages of female shop assistants are
estimated to be 33 per cent. lower than those of male
assistants. I have not been able to find any reason for the
difference beyond the willingness of women to take less
than men. It would be interesting to know whether there
is any real difference in efficiency between the sexes. I
believe that in purely manual occupations lack of
efficiency is enough to account for women’s lower wages;
but in clerical and routine work the reason is not so
obvious.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_7" id="Footnote_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> It is difficult to obtain an accurate estimate of the average wages
of women shop assistants. The figures in the text were given me
by the Secretary of the National Union of Shop Assistants. Miss
Collet (<i>Report to Labour Commission</i>, p. 86) gives a table of salaries
varying from £7 16<i>s.</i> to £75 per annum. Probably about 10<i>s.</i> a week
is the <i>average</i> wage, but many who have worked for some years earn, it
would seem from the table, about £1 a week, generally without board.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Fines.</b>&mdash;The nominal wages of a shop assistant, however,
whether high or low to start with, are subject to serious
deductions by the way. Few large retail houses are free
from a system of vexatious fines, deducted nominally from
premiums on sales. I have before me a fine-book belonging
to a large London house containing nearly a hundred rules,
to the breach of which fines varying from 6<i>d.</i> to 5<i>s.</i> are
attached, with threats of even worse penalties behind. Thus
for standing on a chair the fine is 6<i>d.</i>; permitting customers
to go unserved without calling special attention of buyer
or shopwalker, 1<i>s.</i>; second offence reported. Omission of
particulars as to filling up duplicate forms and returning
change, at discretion up to 5<i>s.</i>; for sending bad coin to
cashier, the loss to be made up, and 1<i>s.</i> fine as well.
For not having premiums credited on exchange or return
of goods, fine 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, second offence dismissal. Wrong or
insufficient address, 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, and so on through a dozen
closely-printed pages, until one wonders how human
ingenuity could devise so many punishable offences. In
another book of rules, more moderate in dimensions, and
animated by a less vindictive spirit than the above, a fine
of 6<i>d.</i> is levied for taking wrong change, and only half the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
deficiency is charged when bad coin is presented. Allowing
a customer to go unserved without calling the attention of
the “buyer,” however, still incurs a fine of 1<i>s.</i> Regulations
such as these sufficiently explain the over-eagerness of shop
assistants to sell, which is often so annoying to their
customers. The unhappy victims of the fine-book have no
choice but to cajole or worry the customer into buying,
since their very livelihood depends upon success. Where
such minute attention to details is necessary as in shop
work, fines may be to some extent a necessary evil; but
there can hardly be sufficient reason for the endless
multiplication of petty exactions which an examination of
fine-books reveals. One would gladly see the system
exchanged for some plan of profit-sharing which would
secure the co-operation of assistants by more agreeable
means. It is true that a bonus on purchases is sometimes
given during the annual sale, but this apparent boon is
again accompanied by a liability to fines which must detract
considerably from its advantages.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_8" id="Footnote_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> Miss Collet (<i>Report, The Employment of Women</i>, p. 88) quotes a
witness who stated that her fines sometimes exceeded her premiums.
“Anyone,” added this witness, “who left the counter on account of
illness was fined for absence.”</p>

</div>

<p><b>Agreements.</b>&mdash;On entering a situation shop assistants
are often obliged to sign agreements which place them
practically at the mercy of their employers. In some
cases they agree to accept instant dismissal if fault is found
with their work or conduct, in which case they bind themselves
not to take action in a court of law. A girl may
thus be discharged at a moment’s notice, and find herself
literally in the streets,<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> The formation of a strong Trade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
Union among shop assistants is probably the only measure
that can avail to check such injustice.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_9" id="Footnote_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> Miss Collet (<i>ibid.</i> p. 88) states that “in the majority of cases a
moment’s notice [of dismissal] was the rule. No wages are in the
latter case paid in lieu of notice, and the only provision to secure that
they shall not be absolutely penniless when they leave is the retention
by the employer of the first week or fortnight’s wages, which are paid
to them on dismissal. The matron of a home said that in one case a
shop assistant who came to her was unable to obtain even this from her
former employer. The power to dismiss at a moment’s notice is not
merely reserved for grave offences, but seems to be frequently exercised
on most trivial grounds,” and the examples given by Miss Collet fully
bear out the truth of the statement.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Long Hours.</b>&mdash;The most trying feature of a shop
assistant’s life, however, is the long hours of labour. Upon
this point agitation is at present centred, and rightly, since
the length of the working day is not only an evil in itself,
but renders the other ills which assistants suffer more difficult
to bear and less easy to remove. In order to amend
the conditions of their life assistants must have leisure to
combine, for nothing breaks the spirit like unceasing toil.
At present, as was pathetically remarked by a shop assistant,
“counter and bed is the common lot of most of us,” and
energies enfeebled by a long day’s work are unequal to
grappling with the problem of reform. Both sexes work
under the same conditions; women keep the same long
hours as men; nor would they regard with approval special
legislation in their favour, fearing lest the indirect result of
such legislation should be to restrict their employment.
How far such a result is really probable it is not easy to
say. The Secretary of the Early Closing Association,
giving evidence before the Select Committee on the
Shop Hours Regulation Bill (1892), expressed himself
satisfied that the limitation of women’s hours proposed by
the Bill would not prejudice their employment; but though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
the contention is probably correct as far as the drapery
trade is concerned, it is by no means certain that it would
hold good of other trades, and women cashiers and clerks
would certainly be replaced by men in shops where the
latter are most largely employed. On the other hand, the
greater cheapness of women’s labour might enable it to
keep its place. It is probable, however, that in any case
the restriction would be used as an excuse for lowering
women’s wages still further.</p>

<p>The act of 1886 limited the hours of children employed
in shops to seventy-four; but as no provision was made
for inspection to enforce it, the act became a dead letter.
The Act of 1892 extended the benefits of restricted hours
to “young persons,” but left the appointment of inspectors
optional. A few large towns are enforcing the Act by
appointing inspectors. As, with these exceptions, each
employer is free to do what seems right in his own eyes,
shop hours vary indefinitely, and it is impossible to give
any figures that are of universal application. An assistant
giving evidence before the Select Committee stated that in
Chelsea, Fulham, and Hammersmith she had worked from
88 to 90 hours a week, but in Holloway only 63½. Other
cases as bad, or even worse, might be cited. A representative
of the Early Closing Association estimated the
average hours in the southern and eastern districts of
London at from 75 to 91 per week, but I am inclined to
think this estimate exaggerated.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> London shops in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
poorer districts however are great sinners in the matter of
late hours. As a rule hours are shortest in the central
districts of large towns, since the exodus of the wealthier
classes to the suburbs as evening comes on renders it
useless to keep shops open after six or seven o’clock.
Saturday afternoon’s holiday is gained in the same manner.
As we move towards the suburbs, and towards the working
class districts, the hours become longer, and on Saturday,
instead of the desired half holiday, toil is prolonged far into
the evening, it may be even till midnight. In Manchester,
which is said to stand well on the whole from the shop
assistant’s point of view, the hours in the central district
are about 66 to 68 weekly, in some few cases 50 only, and
in the suburbs 80; but in many parts of the city much
longer hours are kept, and late Saturday night shopping
prevails in the working class districts. To some extent
this is inevitable; but in a city like Manchester, where
the Saturday half-holiday is general, such extremely late
shop hours can hardly be necessary, and with regard to
other towns also the necessity of late hours for the shopping
of the working classes is probably much exaggerated. It
is well known that so long as shops are open customers will
come, and if purchases could be made at three o’clock
in the morning, individuals would probably be found who
preferred that time to any other. The Select Committee
of the House of Commons on the Shop Hours Regulation
Bill of 1888, reported that they were “satisfied that the
hours of shop assistants range in many places as high as
from eighty-four to eighty-five hours per week,” and were
further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span> “convinced that such long hours must be generally
injurious and often ruinous to health, and that the same
amount of business might be compressed into a shorter
space of time.” Eighty-five hours too, as we have seen, are
by no means the extreme limit of weekly work. It is a
common thing for shops opened at eight in the morning to
be kept open until nine o’clock at night; and what chance,
it may be asked, has a girl released at that hour after a
long day’s toil of enjoying healthy recreation? A rational
life is impossible under such conditions.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_10" id="Footnote_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> Miss Collet’s tables give 50 to 74 hours, exclusive of meals, but
no attempt is made to find the average hours. And, as Miss Collet
remarks, “those working long hours are most inaccessible, from the
very fact that they have no time to go to social meetings, and have less
courage to complain.” Miss Orme gives the average hours in Welsh
shops at 54¾ a week, the highest being 62½ and the lowest 51½.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Standing.</b>&mdash;The long hours of standing are of course
apt to be injurious to the health of women, and especially
of young girls. Physicians give evidence of diseases contracted
in this manner, and the report of the “Sanitary
Commission” of the <i>Lancet</i>, though moderate in expression,
is sufficiently explicit upon this point.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> It must be remembered,
however, that constitutions differ, and I have been
informed by a young woman who had served ten years in a
shop (where, however, short hours are kept) that while she
herself had grown used to the standing, her sister, serving
in the same shop, was quite unable to endure the fatigue,
and had failed seriously in health. A few years ago some
well-meaning persons, urged on by the <i>Lancet</i>, exerted
themselves to get seats provided for shop assistants, and
their efforts were apparently successful. Subsequent investigations
by the <i>Lancet</i> commissioner, however, disclosed a
serious flaw in the arrangements. In one shop he found
that although seats were provided anyone “found idle” was
fined 6<i>d.</i> “At another very large establishment,” reported
the commissioner, “which boasts of the seats it provides,
anyone found using them is reprimanded the first time, and
dismissed on a repetition of the offence.” The episode is
instructive as showing how impossible it is for outsiders to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
reform trade abuses. Shop assistants must themselves
combine for the removal of their grievances if any improvement
is to be effected. In the same way “consumers’
leagues,” for the avoidance of late shopping or for boycotting
shops where sweating is carried on, are doomed beforehand
to failure. Combination among the workers, backed
by judicious legislation, is the only sure method of securing
reform.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_11" id="Footnote_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> The Report of the Lady Assistant Commissioners fully confirms
the same opinion.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_12" id="Footnote_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> An ingenious method in use in some Welsh towns deserves notice.
Shops which are kept open late are picketed by men carrying cards, on
which is printed, “You are requested to do your shopping before 7
p.m.” Miss Orme had such a card handed to her at Swansea, and on
enquiry found that the agitation thus raised by the National Union of
Shop Assistants had been very successful in shortening hours.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Insanitary Conditions.</b>&mdash;An evil almost as great as
the long hours of labour is the insanitary condition of many
shops. In large establishments proper arrangements are
usually made, though it often happens that the building is
draughty or ill-ventilated. But in small shops there is sometimes
no sanitary provision whatever, and assistants must
have recourse to the nearest public house, the only lavatory
available. Shops that are merely “fronts” have of course
no offices attached, and in those built on to private houses
the proprietor often reserves the house premises entirely for
his own family. The abuse is a crying one, and from its
nature it is difficult to expose. Small shops are also often
close, ill-ventilated, and full of foul odours, though perhaps
women do not suffer from the latter cause as much as men,
being less employed in provision shops, pawnbrokers’, or
fur shops. Women cashiers, however, who are confined all
day in the elevated boxes rendered necessary by the rolling
ball system of giving change, suffer severely from the
accumulation of gas and bad air towards the ceiling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Living-in.</b>&mdash;Another matter with regard to which discontent
is rapidly spreading is the system of compulsory
“living-in,” which prevails widely in drapery and large
outfitting establishments. This custom is, I believe,
unknown in Scotland. A drapery firm in the North of
England, for example, employs 300 assistants of both sexes,
and all are obliged to live in the house provided by the
employer. In shops where “living-in” is compulsory board
and lodging is usually valued at £40 per annum. It is a
common complaint, however, among assistants that if after
some years’ service they obtain the privilege of living “out”
they only receive an allowance of £15 or £20 per annum.
This statement has been made over and over again, and its
truth can hardly be doubted. For the sum charged by the
employer the inmates of a large house ought to be
comfortably fed and housed; but though in some cases the
arrangements are all that could be desired, yet against
the majority grave accusations are made with regard to over-crowding,
bad food, and uncomfortable household arrangements.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
The bedroom accommodation is said to be
insufficient, and the furniture scanty; the food provided
is often poor, and sometimes uneatable. Sundry small
filchings in the shape of charges for blacking boots, use of
piano and library, are also strongly resented. There is
seldom any provision for social life, perhaps because there
would be no time to enjoy it. Usually the two sexes
are lodged apart, but some boarding houses are apparently
mixed, for in one set of house rules it is stated that
talking in the dining-room during meals is “strictly
prohibited,” that the young men are not permitted to
enter the young ladies’ sitting-room, and visitors are not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
allowed in the house. At most establishments only
twenty minutes or half-an-hour is allowed for dinner, and the
assistants are liable to be called off if required in the shop.
On this system meals must be simply bolted, to the no
small injury of the digestion; and it is not surprising that
dyspeptic derangement is a common ailment of shop
assistants.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_13" id="Footnote_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> The Lady Commissioners’ reports are full of these complaints.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Sundays.</b>&mdash;When Sunday comes round a diametrically
opposite policy is followed, and after being kept in close
confinement during six days of the week the unhappy
assistant finds himself or herself put outside the door on
the seventh. Either the boarders are given to understand
that their presence is not desired within doors, or else no
meals are provided, and the assistants are left to shift for
themselves as best they may. No doubt the best-conducted
houses are careful of their assistants’ comfort on Sundays.
Extreme cases, in which the assistants are absolutely shut
out, are probably rare; but some are known to exist, and
the tendency to make Sunday an uncomfortable day for
those who remain indoors appears to be pretty general.
The disastrous consequences of throwing female assistants&mdash;often
mere girls&mdash;upon their own resources on the day in
the week when respectable means of shelter or refreshment
are least accessible can easily be imagined. Here again
a strong Trade Union seems to afford the only possible
chance of dealing with the evil. The stress of competition
is ever at work, driving employers to diminish their
expenses in every possible way in order to sell their wares
at the cheapest rate; and it is so easy to effect the needful
economies out of the domestic establishment of their
assistants. It will be readily perceived too that the
system of compulsory “living-in” places the assistants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
more completely in the power of their employers than is
desirable for any body of workers, and the assistants
themselves do not hesitate to affirm that this is the chief
cause of its maintenance. Incidentally also it disfranchises
the men, who are not able to claim even the
lodgers’ franchise. Attempts are made in some places by
philanthropic societies to provide homes for girls employed
in shops where living-in is not compulsory. These may
be useful in some cases, but their usual defect is a too
maternal government, which the girls resent.</p>

<p><b>Personal Narratives.</b>&mdash;In support of what has been
here stated as to the general conditions of shop work, I
may add some particulars gleaned from one or two lady
shop assistants who have been kind enough to tell me
frankly their experience. Both are now employed in shops
with whose management they are perfectly content, but
their previous experiences were of a far less agreeable
nature. Miss Smith served for some time in a drapery
establishment in a second-rate quarter of a large town.
The hours were from 9 a.m. to 9.30 p.m., and to 10, 10.30,
or later on Saturdays. No annual holidays were given;
the assistants were supposed to have one free day a month,
but often they did not get it. An hour was allowed for
dinner, which the assistants had to provide either in or out
of the building. As my informant’s home was half an
hour distant she brought her own dinner, and thus was
unable to have warm food. When engaged in the millinery
department she divided her time between the showroom
and the workroom, and was often kept until 12.30 on
Saturday night, or rather Sunday morning, finishing orders.
Her sister had been similarly employed in a small country
town for eighteen months, during most of which time the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
working hours were so long that from Monday morning
until Sunday morning she only left the counter for bed.
“At the end of the time,” added Miss Smith, “she was
carried home in blankets,” having broken down completely
under the hard conditions of her life. “Country shops,”
remarked Miss Smith, “are the worst of all; the work is
never at an end.” Asked if she had ever found deficient
sanitary arrangements, she stated that in an otherwise well-managed
shop the housekeeper had at one time, from some
whim, taken to locking the lavatories, opening them only at
certain intervals. The rebellion that ensued, however, had
forced her to relinquish the practice. Some small shops, it
was added, were “merely square rooms,” and were unprovided
with offices.</p>

<p>Miss Jones had had a varied experience. In her first
situation&mdash;a suburban shop, where she lived in the house&mdash;the
hours were from 8.30 a.m. to 9.30 p.m., with the usual
additional hours on Saturday. “I always went straight to
bed after my work,” she said, “for there was only the
kitchen to sit in, and one could not go out at that time
of night.” A large second-class shop in a provincial town
was not much better. The hours were from 8.30 a.m. to
8.30 p.m., twenty minutes being allowed for dinner, and
a quarter of an hour for tea. A week’s holiday was given
in summer. The assistants lived in the house; no talking
was allowed at meals; and if, as was not unnatural among
a gathering of young people of both sexes, the place of
conversation was supplied by giggling, the “governor”
seated at the head of the table growled his disapprobation.
“Our only amusement was to kick each other under the
table to make one another laugh,” observed Miss Jones;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
“but where I am now we talk as much as we like, and
enjoy ourselves.” In the first-named establishment there
were many fines, in the house as well as in the shop.
Four girls slept in a bedroom, two in each bed; if the
gas was left lit after a certain hour, the room-mates were
all fined 6<i>d.</i> a head, innocent and guilty alike.</p>

<p>My informants laid stress upon the time taken up by
straightening the shop after closing hours, an extra burden
which is sometimes unavoidable. In a shop which closed
at 6.30 Miss Jones had sometimes been busy “straightening”
gloves (<i>i.e.</i> arranging them in their boxes and sorting the
sizes) till 10 o’clock or even later. At sale times such extra
work is frequent. Neither speaker objected to the system
of fines if reasonably administered, but they thought it
hard to be fined for not making a sale when the article
demanded was actually not in stock. About the pressure
put upon assistants to effect sales they had some amusing
stories. On one occasion a buyer brought a lady customer
to the counter where Miss Jones was serving, with the
request that she would show her “furniture fringes,” adding
in a low tone, “And see that she gets them.” Miss Jones,
who knew that furniture fringes were not in the shop, was
at her wits’ end. “I showed her everything I could think
of,” she said, “and kept her there until I saw the buyer
move away, when I whispered hastily, ‘We <i>haven’t got</i> any
furniture fringes,’ and the lady took her departure.
Fortunately the buyer forgot to ask me any questions
afterwards. Another time a lady asked for a kind of beaded
dress front which we did not keep; but because I let her
go without calling up the buyer I was fined 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>”</p>

<p>The details here given from personal experience amply
bear out what has been said about the difficulties and
disagreeables of a shop assistant’s life, and they may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
multiplied <i>ad infinitum</i> by anyone who cares to make
personal investigation into the subject.</p>

<p><b>Warehouses.</b>&mdash;The conditions of life in warehouses
are much the same as in shops, but some of the special
grievances of the latter are absent. Fines, though not
wholly unknown, are not customary, and “living-in,”
though practised to some extent, especially among London
city firms, is not general throughout the country. Women
are much employed in furriers’ and trimming warehouses.
Wages are poor&mdash;often only from 7<i>s.</i> to 10<i>s.</i> a week; but a
good saleswoman in a wholesale house may earn as much
as £1 a week. Long hours, poor wages, and insanitary
conditions are the chief grievances of warehouse assistants,
and they are making common cause with workers in shops
for their removal.</p>

<p><b>Combination among Assistants.</b>&mdash;Strenuous efforts
are now being made to secure combination among
shop assistants, but the task is not easy. Shop assistants
are apt to regard such measures as suitable only to
artisans and labourers, failing to perceive that from lack
of combination they themselves are often much worse
treated than the labourers whose methods of self-defence
they despise. No artisan would think for a moment of
enduring the conditions with regard to fines, forms of
agreement, and method of living, which are imposed upon
shop assistants, whose hours of labour are also, as I
have shown, far beyond those worked by factory
“hands.”<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> The fear of dismissal is a more real cause
for hesitation; but if the union is carefully organised, and
causes of offence are avoided during its early days, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
seems no reason why this objection should not gradually
disappear. There are now in existence the “United
Shop Assistants’ Union,” the “National Union of Shop
Assistants, Warehousemen, and Clerks,” with head-quarters
in London, and branches in most of the large
towns, and the “National Union of Clerks”; besides an
outside society, the “Early Closing Association,” which
works for one special object&mdash;the shortening of shop
hours. The others are unions for mutual help and
defence, and the “National Union of Shop Assistants,
Warehousemen, and Clerks,” which has about 2,000
members, is constituted upon genuine Trade Union lines,
giving sick benefits and out-of-work pay upon a graduated
scale for payments of 1<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> to 2<i>s.</i> a month.</p>

<p>The passing of the Shop Hours Regulation Act can
hardly be expected to effect any general improvement
in shop hours; but if efficiently carried out it should
do something to shorten the working hours of those for
whom it is specially designed&mdash;children and young persons.
It is satisfactory to note that several towns are appointing
inspectors, without whose aid the Act would remain
nugatory, and that a number of women are among those
appointed. It is highly improbable that public opinion
will rest content with such a very imperfect piece of work
as the Act of 1892; and before long we may expect
to see the working hours of all shop assistants limited
by law. If the coming legislation affects all shops alike
(with necessary exceptions for special trades, such as
chemists), it is not likely to meet with strong opposition,
since it is the competition of one shopkeeper with another
which forms the chief obstacle to a voluntary change.
Often the refusal of a single shopkeeper prevents the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
adoption of early closing in a whole district. If all are
obliged to close no injury is done, and large employers
of labour gave evidence in this sense before the Select
Committee. Happily, in this case, the question admits
of being considered upon its own merits, and we need not
fear the appearance of that familiar hindrance to labour
reform, the bugbear of foreign competition.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_14" id="Footnote_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> Miss Collet’s tables of factory and shop hours (Report, p. 85)

<h3>ADDENDUM.</h3>

<p>This chapter was written before the publication of the Blue Book on
“The Employment of Women,” which contains detailed and valuable
reports upon the work of shop assistants by Miss Orme and Miss Collet.
As the evidence given above is fully confirmed by the Commissioners’
Reports, I have left the chapter as it stood, with the addition of a few
foot-notes, as an independent contribution to the study of the question.
Those who wish to pursue the matter further may do so profitably by
reading the Reports in full. I cannot leave the subject, however,
without quoting Miss Collet’s impressive summary of the effects of shop
work and life upon the health of those employed (p. 88).</p>

<p>“The constant supervision of the shop walker, the patience and
politeness to be shown to the most trying customers, the difficulty of
telling the truth about the goods without incurring the displeasure of
the managers, the long standing, the close atmosphere even in well-ventilated
shops when crowded with customers, the short time for
meals, the care required to keep things in their right places and to
make out accounts correctly, the long evenings with gaslight, and the
liability to dismissal without warning or explained reason, all tend to
render the occupation of the shop assistants most trying to the nerves
and injurious to health.” And she adds: “It is a significant fact that
whereas large numbers of factory girls cannot be prevailed upon to give
up their factory work after marriage, the majority of shop assistants
look upon marriage as their one hope of relief, and would, as one girl
expressed it, ‘marry anybody to get out of the drapery business.’”</p>

<p>The history of combination among women lies within a
narrow compass. Its action has been confined entirely to
the working classes, and even among them the period of
its existence is as yet but short. No organization fulfilling
the purposes of a Trade Union is to be found among
women of the cultured classes, and the corporations by
which professional and commercial men secure the maintenance
of a definite system of employment and a fixed
standard of payment have no parallel among workers of
the other sex. So far as women join the ranks of a profession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
already thus guarded&mdash;as, for instance, the medical
profession&mdash;they share its privileges, and we are thus
spared the spectacle of women doctors underselling their
male colleagues, and earning their maledictions thereby.
There are various associations of women engaged in
teaching, but these as a rule are formed purely for educational
purposes, and are powerless to defend or protect
their members in any way. Indirectly, however, they may
serve some of the purposes of a Trade Union. Thus the
Association of Assistant Mistresses in secondary schools,
though carefully disclaiming all title to be called a Trade
Union, is able, by means of friendly conferences with
headmistresses as well as by the information it disseminates
among its members, and the publicity which it is able to
give to matters in which their interests are concerned, to
confer upon its members some of the minor benefits of
combination. The National Union of Teachers in elementary
schools (men and women) comes much nearer to
the Trade Union type; but though affording its members
valuable aid, and able through its Parliamentary Committee
seriously to influence legislation, it is not constituted
upon a Trade Union basis, and does not profess to fulfil
its functions. The associations recently formed among
men and women employed in shops are, however, Trade
Unions, both in intention and in fact; but with this
solitary, though important, exception, the progress of
unionism among women has been entirely confined to the
classes engaged in strictly manual labour.</p>

<p><b>Emma Paterson.</b>&mdash;There is no difficulty in fixing
the date of the first beginnings of Trades Unionism among
women, or in assigning the credit of its foundation to the
right quarter. The date was 1874, and the founder was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Emma Paterson, <i>née</i> Smith. I am here speaking of purely
women’s unions, for it must not be forgotten that large
unions of men and women had existed for many years in
the textile trades of the North of England. Emma Smith
was the daughter of a schoolmaster, and was carefully
educated by her father. She gained early practice in organisation
in connection with the Working Men’s Club
and Institute Union, and gave such evidence of talent in
this direction that when only nineteen she was appointed
assistant secretary. After five years’ service Emma Smith
became Secretary of the Women’s Suffrage Association, and
her early practical experience, combined with the theoretical
discussions upon the position of women to which she was
now introduced, led her to think seriously about their
industrial position also. In 1873 Miss Smith became
Mrs. Paterson, and with her husband, a former hon.
secretary of the Institute previously mentioned, and hardly
less interested than herself in labour questions, she started
for a tour in America, undertaken partly with a view to
studying the operations of Friendly Societies in that country.
She had been deeply struck with some remarks that had
fallen from an American lady lecturer upon this subject,
and the idea of a similar organisation at home for women
took root and germinated in her thoughtful mind. In
America she learnt with interest that experiments in
women’s unions had already been made, and showed some
prospect of success. On her return to England Mrs.
Paterson wrote a paper, which was published in the <i>Labour
News</i>, advocating the formation of a national union for
improving the position of working women. The article
contained a careful <i>resumé</i> of the question, and showed
that the writer possessed a thorough insight into her subject.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
It was pointed out that women are almost always worse
paid than men, even when equally skilled; that their isolation
as workers exposes them to reductions of wages from unscrupulous
employers, which their more honourable rivals
are compelled to imitate. In support of the “benefit”
side of Unionism Mrs. Paterson cites a curious case. “At
a time of great slackness of trade among the bookbinders,
in 1871, caused by a delay in passing through the House
of Commons the revised Prayer Book, it was stated that
during sixteen months two of the men’s unions had paid
£2,500 in relieving their unemployed members, but that
the women in the trade, having no union to fall back upon,
had suffered the greatest distress.” Mrs. Paterson then
deals with the popular scepticism as to women’s powers
of combination. “At three successive annual congresses
of leaders and delegates of Trades Unions the need of
women’s unions has been brought before them, and each
time someone present has asserted that women <i>cannot</i>
form unions. The only ground for this assertion,” adds
Mrs. Paterson courageously, “appears to be that women
<i>have not</i> yet formed unions. Probably they have not
done so because they have not quite seen how to set
about it.”</p>

<p><b>Women’s Protective and Provident League.</b>&mdash;The
first result of Mrs. Paterson’s paper was that a conference
was convened to consider her proposal. Many
friends outside the ranks of labour attended the meeting
held in the Quebec Institute on July 8th, 1874, at which
Mr. Hodgson Pratt presided. Resolutions were passed to
the effect&mdash;</p>

<p>1. That a Committee be appointed, to be entitled the
Women’s Protective and Provident Committee.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>2. That one of the objects of the Association shall be to
enable women earning their own livelihood to combine to
protect their interests.</p>

<p>3. That it shall be one of the objects of the Association
to provide a benefit fund for assistance in sickness and
other contingencies.</p>

<p>A committee was elected, and Mrs. Paterson was appointed
honorary secretary, a post which she held until
her death in 1886.</p>

<p>The resolutions here quoted indicate sufficiently clearly
the objects of the Association. It was considered necessary,
however, not to proclaim these too loudly to a world
unprepared for their reception, and accordingly the use of
the term “Trade Union” was carefully avoided. Public
opinion had not then been enlisted in favour of the principle
of combination for either men or women; employers were
not likely to regard amicably a further extension of the
methods against which they had already fought so obstinately,
and working men as a class had not yet grasped
the importance, in the interests of labour generally, of
the complete adoption of unionism by workers of both
sexes. Their attitude was to some extent one of suspicion
towards women, on account of their readiness to
undersell the labour of men. It behoved the friends of
the movement to walk guardedly, and to disarm suspicion
until their cause had gained strength. The cumbrous
title “Women’s Protective and Provident League” first
adopted, directed attention accordingly to one side only
of the work&mdash;that of insurance against sickness&mdash;while
veiling its trade union aspect under the vague adjective
“protective.” More stress was laid than would perhaps
now be the case upon the advantage to be derived from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
the sick benefit funds of the unions. The courage and
hopes of the women were hardly raised to the point of
making sacrifices for an organization of whose powers as a
bulwark against oppression they were ignorant, but the
prospect of receiving payment when out of work was
something that the most timid could appreciate.</p>

<p><b>Bristol Association.</b>&mdash;A Working Women’s Association
was founded in Bristol in 1874 upon similar lines to
those of the League, and under the influence of the same
inspiration, Mrs. Paterson having circulated her paper and
attended a conference in that city. The society is still in
existence.</p>

<p><b>Bookbinders’ Union.</b>&mdash;The progress made during
the first year of the League’s life was slow; but, as all
who have watched the growth of social organisms are well
aware, a period of struggle and slow progress is the
unavoidable preliminary of growth in any movement which
is firmly grounded. The Union of Women employed in
Bookbinding was formed in 1874, and was followed next
year by that of the Upholsteresses and the Shirt and Collar
Makers, societies which are all still alive, though not large
in numbers. The bookbinding trade was selected for the
first experiment, partly because a recent period of trade
depression had made the want of a provident society
severely felt, but still more because Mr. King, the secretary
of the London Consolidated Society of Bookbinders,
undertook to give the women all the help in his power
in the work of forming a trades union. “There is no
provision,” remarks the Report of the League’s work for
1874,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span> “for the admission of women as members of the
men’s societies either in bookbinding or other trades, with
some few exceptions in the North of England. Nor
would the women be able to avail themselves of such
provision, as they could not pay the same subscription,
their wages seldom being more than half those of the men.”
Here we have the whole case in a nutshell&mdash;women completely
unorganized, and disabled by their poverty from
making use of the levers by which men had raised their
position. It is gratifying to be able to add that several of
the men’s unions have recently admitted women at a lower
rate of contribution. About the same time unions of
women were formed in Dewsbury and also in Leicester,
where, it was stated, the stitchers and seamers in the
hosiery trade received only 5<i>s.</i> a week. A meeting was
called by some gentlemen of the town who recognised the
mischief of allowing wages to diminish unchecked, and a
union was formed, which was able almost immediately to
obtain for its members a small advance of wages.</p>

<p><b>Trades Congress, Liverpool.</b>&mdash;In January, 1874,
the Trades Congress met in Liverpool, and Mrs. Paterson
addressed a letter to the members upon the subject of
combination among women. The letter was read by the
President (Mr. Julian), and the Congress expressed hearty
approval of the movement. Meanwhile the Committee of
the League busied itself in stimulating the young societies
by means of social gatherings and entertainments, and by
holding meetings and endeavouring to arouse public
interest. A room was rented in Holborn, and was used
for small meetings and as a house of call for women out
of work.</p>

<p><b>Provincial Unions. Women Delegates to
Congress.</b>&mdash;In 1875 and the following year efforts were
made by the League to organise working women in the
provinces. Meetings were held in Glasgow, Manchester,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
and Sheffield, and unions were formed in various trades;
but though the co-operation of the local Trades Council
was enlisted, not many of the societies then formed
have survived. An event of more import was the admission
of women to the Trades Congress at Glasgow
in 1875, where Miss Simcox represented the Shirt and
Collar Makers, and Mrs. Paterson the Bookbinders and the
Upholstresses. A resolution pledging the members of the
Congress to promote trades unions among women was
moved by Mr. Shipton, of the London Trades Council,
and carried unanimously. Since 1875 women have been
present at each annual meeting of the Trades Congress,
and have invariably been received with courtesy and goodwill.
During the next few years unions of women were
formed in London as follows:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="Unions" class="max35">
  <tr>
    <td>Tailoresses’ Union</td><td class="tdr">1877</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Dressmakers’, Milliners’, and Mantle Makers’ Union</td><td class="tdr">1878</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Westminster and Pimlico Branch of the Tailoresses’ Union</td><td class="tdr">1879</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>East London Tailoresses’ Union</td><td class="tdr">1879</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The societies thus formed were for the most part small,
the total membership only reaching about 1,300 in 1879;
but they held well together, and their financial position
was sound. In 1879 the Society of Women employed in
Bookbinding was able to report that after paying during
the year benefits amounting to £37 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, a balance
of £218 12<i>s.</i> remained in hand. The Upholsteresses’
Society had paid £23 15<i>s.</i> in benefits, and had a balance
of £98 18<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> In all cases the societies had paid their
own working expenses, the funds of the League being only
employed in giving them a fair start.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Army Clothing Factory.</b>&mdash;In 1879 the good offices
of the League were employed in bringing the grievances
of the women working in the Royal Army Clothing
Factory at Pimlico under notice of the House of Commons,
and in obtaining the appointment of a Committee
of Inquiry. This is probably the first case in which
the conditions of women’s labour have been investigated
at the request of the workers themselves. Similar
grievances cropped up in 1882, and once more in 1885-6.
The League, as before, took up the women’s case, holding
conferences and attracting public attention to the matter.
The result was a searching inquiry into the management
of the factory, undertaken by Mrs. Fawcett, at the request
of Mr. Woodall, Surveyor-General of Ordnance. Mrs.
Fawcett received the thanks of the Department for her
labours, and the grievances of the women were in great
part redressed.</p>

<p>Two trade societies were formed in Leicester in 1878-9&mdash;the
Cigar Makers’ and the Worsted Spinners’. Members
of the Trades Council again gave their aid, and the
unions thus formed still carry on, under changed names,
a flourishing existence. In the autumn of 1878 five
women attended the Trades Congress held in Bristol, at
which a proposal for the appointment of working men
and women as sub-inspectors of factories was carried
unanimously. The question was brought up again at the
Congress of 1881, and at the instance of the League
Parliament was approached on the subject.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_15" id="Footnote_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> It was not until 1893 that two ladies&mdash;Miss Abraham and
Miss Muirhead Paterson&mdash;were appointed factory inspectors. No
working women have yet been appointed.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Results in 1882.</b>&mdash;For some years the work of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
forming Women’s Unions went on but slowly, and in London,
though persistent efforts were made, no new societies were
permanently established between 1879 and 1888. By 1882
it was found that the seven London unions had received
£1210 in members’ subscriptions, and had paid away
£475 in sick benefits and grants at death. The total
number of unions formed by the League was stated in 1883
to be nineteen, ten in London, and nine in the provinces.
Meetings were held in many towns, and a few unions were
formed, among which may be mentioned a Working
Women’s Society in Oxford, founded in 1881. In Liverpool
the Tailoresses’ Union would have collapsed but for the
help of the League, and the case affords a good example of
the dangers with which the work of combination is beset.
The union was not constituted in a business-like manner,
and the member of the men’s union (afterwards expelled),
who was allowed to act as secretary and treasurer, “neglected,”
as the report euphemistically puts it, to place the
funds in a bank. Suspicion at once took possession of the
society, and subscriptions ceased. The League promptly
came to the rescue, deposited a sum equal to the subscriptions
in a local bank on behalf of the society, and took
means, which were eventually successful, for obtaining
repayment from the secretary.</p>

<p><b>Nailmakers.</b>&mdash;Attention was drawn in 1883 to the
wretched wages earned by women in the nailmaking trade,
by Mr. Broadhurst’s bill (promoted by the Parliamentary
committee of the Trades Congress), prohibiting the employment
in that trade of girls under 14. The bill was thrown
out, but the fact of its having been brought in roused the
women to a sense of their position, and an effort was made
to form a union under the auspices of the League. Wages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
were then quoted at 3<i>s.</i> to 5<i>s.</i> a week. A large number of
women nailmakers are now enrolled in the Midland Trades
Federation, which contains altogether 1500 women.
Unionism in the nail and chain trades has fluctuated
greatly, for the difficulties in the way of combination are
very great. Both Mr. Burnett’s Report to the Board of
Trade and Miss Orme’s to the Labour Commission, show a
wretched condition of life and labour in these districts.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the record of combination among
women, where the support of men’s unions has not been
available, is to some extent a history of abortive attempts.
The experience thus gained, however, has not been wholly
thrown away. It has shown where the attempt is likely to
succeed, and where it is not. As a result, effort is now
being concentrated on the most favourable fields, and recent
events have shown the wisdom of this course. In spite of
many failures, the examples of successful combination are
sufficiently numerous to prove that the task of organising
women’s labour, if difficult, is by no means hopeless.</p>

<p><b>Women’s Union Journal.</b>&mdash;Among other agencies
promoted or encouraged by the League during its early
years were a monthly paper called the <i>Women’s Union
Journal</i> (now issued quarterly as the <i>Women’s Trades
Union Review</i>), a reading-room, where women out of work
could consult advertisements, and employers send notices
of vacancies, a swimming club (which owed its formation
to the horror caused by the sinking of the <i>Princess Alice</i>
in the Thames), a small co-operative society, and contributions
towards a seaside house for members of the Unions.</p>

<p><b>Death of Mrs. Paterson.</b>&mdash;At the end of the year
1886 the unions suffered an irreparable loss in the death
of Mrs. Paterson. Her husband, who had been one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
the earliest members of the League, and took the warmest
interest in its progress, had died a few years before.
Almost since her girlhood, as we have seen, Mrs. Paterson
had striven hard for the advancement of working women,
and her death, at the early age of thirty-eight, was attributed
by her friends to her unwearying labours. She had been
honorary secretary of the League from its foundation, and
since 1875 had attended every meeting of the Trades
Congress but one, besides giving unremitting attention to
the affairs of the individual unions. Mrs. Paterson exercised
a great influence over the working women with whom
she came in contact, and she possessed two qualities which
are not always found together&mdash;enthusiasm for an ideal
and great business powers. To her quiet yet persistent
efforts it is due that the movement did not collapse amid
the many difficulties of its early years, and that the idea of
Trades Unionism among women has been steadily kept
alive. For a short time after Mrs. Paterson’s death, Miss
Clementina Black held the post of secretary to the League,
but resigned in 1889, and became connected with a new
organization, similar in aim, called the “Women’s Trades
Union Association.” Her place was taken by Miss Emilie
Holyoake, daughter of the well-known co-operator, Miss
Florence Routledge, <span class="smcap">B.A.</span>, becoming honorary secretary.</p>

<p><b>Match-Girls’ Strike.</b>&mdash;The years 1888 and 1889
marked a great upheaval in the labour market. The first
saw the match-girls’ strike, the second the dockers’ strike.
The great silent mass of struggling, starving, unskilled
labour then for the first time found voice, and its utterance,
expressed in the unmistakable terms of a deadly struggle,
and following hard upon the revelations made before
the Commission on the Sweating System, brought home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
to the outside world the real state of things prevailing
in the lower ranks of labour. Thus the public mind was
prepared to show something more than passive sympathy
with the rebellion which broke out soon afterwards
among unskilled labourers. The strike of the girls
in Messrs. Bryant and May’s factory, though dwarfed in
interest by the dockers’ strike which followed, was still a
remarkable episode, unique indeed in the history of combination
among women. The beginning of the strike
found the girls entirely without organization, its close left
them with increased wages, a union nearly a thousand
strong, and for some time afterwards considerably in excess
of that figure. The strikers were ably and courageously
led by Mrs. Annie Besant and Mr. Herbert Burrows, and
their success was also due in no small degree to the support
of the London Trades Council, which took the part
of the girls, and sent a deputation to press their claims
upon the firm. By thus gaining over public sympathy
and winning the open countenance of the official element
in Trades Unionism the match-girls’ strike may be said to
have marked a new departure, for, though similar help had
often been rendered by Trades Councils before, the
publicity attached to this occasion made it specially noteworthy.
Public opinion, too, though a fickle friend, is still
a friend worth having, and whilst its frown is a penalty
which employers do not willingly incur, its restraining
effect upon hasty action on the other side is also not
without benefit. A certain vague sentiment with regard to
the physical weakness of women and their patience under
poverty and suffering helps to keep public opinion favourable
on the whole, while their disorganized condition prevents
them, as a rule, from adopting the aggressive measures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
which shock and terrify society. So for the present the
outside world looks kindly upon women’s unions, the more
so as these organisations make no demands upon its purse.</p>

<p><b>New Unions. Women’s Trades Union Association.</b>&mdash;Between
1888 and 1890 a number of new unions,
including the Amalgamated Laundresses with several
branches, Matchbox-makers of Shoreditch and Bow, Box-makers
and Confectioners, were formed in London. Of
these some were formed under the auspices of the new
association mentioned above, the Women’s Trades Union
Association. This society aims at promoting unions whose
funds shall be devoted solely to trade purposes, contributions
for sick and out-of-work benefits being either
optional or non-existent. In the opinion of those who
formed the new society the starvation wages paid to women
in many trades render it difficult, if not impossible, to
secure subscriptions upon a scale high enough to allow for
sick benefits, and they consider it best therefore to devote
attention entirely to strengthening the workers’ position in
their respective trades. There is something to be said for this
view of the question, and it is possible that, following the
lines of the “new unionism,” women’s societies may come
into existence which would hardly have been formed upon
any other method. Some belonging to the older organisation,
as, for instance, the Matchbox-makers’ Union, have
already adopted a purely trade basis for combination. The
majority however give sick and out-of-work benefits, and in
many districts the “club” aspect of a union is that which
appeals most strongly to women unexperienced in combination.
The question is one with which men’s unions
are much occupied at present, and its final solution cannot
be foretold as yet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Mixed Unions in the Provinces.</b>&mdash;Meanwhile
unionism has been spreading in the provinces, which
offer a better field for combination than the ill-paid trades
of East London, to which the efforts of the League had
hitherto been directed. Some of the larger unions of
men in the textile trades, as already mentioned, had long
admitted women as members, such as the Northern
Counties Weavers’ Association with 43,000 women
members, and the Card and Blowing-room Operatives
with 21,000 women. The Amalgamated Hosiery Union
of Leicester has 2500, and the Scottish Mill and Factory
workers the same number. The Notts and Leicester
Cigar-makers’ union is an admirable example of a purely
women’s society which early learned to stand on its feet,
and was able to gain signal advantages for its members. It
has a membership of 800, and is said to contain a larger
percentage of those engaged in the trade than any other
society. There are unions of women, either of a general
or special kind, in Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Wakefield,
Denton (where a union in the hat trade contains 4290
members), Glasgow, Belfast, and other towns. Particulars
of their membership are given in an appendix. It will be
seen that by far the largest number of women unionists are
enrolled in the mixed societies of the textile trades. These
constitute the models to which in time unionism will
probably more generally conform in the future, since an
organisation which includes both men and women is free
from the sources of weakness attaching to unions of either
sex singly. When the women of a trade are not included in
the union, they are liable to undersell the men, and unions
of women alone are necessarily weaker than the better
equipped organisations of men. For the present, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
it is necessary to be content with imperfect forms of
combination, and if women are ever to win a place in the
older and stronger societies of men they must first give
evidence of their quality by forming and managing their
own unions. Every year those who make the effort are
gaining increased support from the men’s unions, and in
time there can be no doubt that the cause of labour will be
seen to have no distinction of sex.</p>

<p><b>System of Tours.</b>&mdash;The growth of provincial unions
has been much quickened by the policy recently adopted
by the League,&mdash;now called the Women’s Trades Union
League. A scheme of annual tours has been mapped out,
by which the officials of the League are enabled to visit
periodically districts in which unions are forming, or are
likely to be formed. Sometimes the men’s unions send
to ask for the help of the League to organise the women,
whose readiness to accept lower wages they recognise as a
serious danger to the position of labour as a whole. Often
the women themselves send a request for help, and occasionally
outsiders have invited the League to come and
rouse the impoverished and helpless workers of a district.
Interest in the subject is sometimes awakened by a discussion
at a political meeting, and various clubs and associations
have from time to time invited a member of the League’s
Committee to give an address upon women’s unions. If
after some such beginning the ground seems ready for
working, and especially if the local Trades Council advises,
a meeting of women is called, and the officials of the
League, aided by such friendly supporters as the district
may afford, explain the advantages of combination. Afterwards
the names of those willing to join a union are
taken down, and a date is arranged for a business meeting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
at which officers are chosen and rules formed. Members
of the Trades Council are generally present at the second
meeting, to put the women in the way of arranging their
affairs. The society is now formed, and it may seem that
everything is going well; but the difficulties in the way of
successful unionism among a class so poor and so unaccustomed
to the methods of combination as the majority of
working-women are very great, and it is often found that in
a few months membership has dwindled to a small number,
and the hopeful prospects of the opening weeks have
entirely disappeared. Often the committee is not up to
its work, accounts are badly kept, or the collectors are
unable to arrange a good working method for getting in
subscriptions, a matter which is by no means easy when
the employers or their managers and foremen happen to
view the formation of the union with disfavour. Then
again, if, as sometimes happens, suspicion arises that the
hard-earned funds are being mismanaged, the union will
melt away as if by magic, to be re-organised only with
great difficulty. In order to avoid this danger as far as
may be, and to give the newly-formed union an incentive
to perseverance, the League promises a second visit at the
end of a year to those societies which affiliate themselves to
the central body. A plan of spring and autumn tours has
been arranged, and by grouping a number of industrial
centres in one part of the country the emissaries of the
League have been enabled to cover much more ground
than would have been possible in a series of detached
visits. In this manner Lady Dilke, Miss Routledge, Miss
Holyoake, and others, have visited most of the manufacturing
districts of England and Scotland, and have even
carried their missionary enterprise as far as Belfast, where,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
since the Trades Congress of 1893 great efforts have been
made to organise the labour of the women working in the
linen and flax mills. Many of the unions thus formed are
affiliated to the League, including a number in Scotland
and the large mixed union of West Riding Power-Loom
Weavers, who have joined the League as far as their
women members are concerned. Recently a further step
has been taken, by sending out working women who have
had experience in their own unions, as organisers into
districts where new unions are being formed; and it is
expected that this plan will be found extremely useful, as
women who are already overworked and underpaid have
little strength or leisure for arranging the preliminaries of
organisation.</p>

<p><b>Difficulties of Combination.</b>&mdash;The difficulty of
forming unions among women is undeniably great. Women
are inexperienced in combination, and they entertain a
lively and by no means groundless fear of the resentment
of their employers. Unionism does not, it is true, often
meet with opposition from the better class of employers,
who recognise in it a salutary check on the efforts of unscrupulous
rivals to force down both prices and wages.
Experience shews them, too, that unionism discourages
rather than fosters strikes, and in cases of difficulty they
would often prefer to deal with the accredited representatives
of the workpeople. But in many cases the attempt to form
a combination among women meets with the open hostility
of their employers. It is not uncommon for a woman who
has undertaken the secretaryship of a union to be summarily
dismissed. The manager of a confectionery factory
in a large provincial town recently attempted to turn away
all those who had given in their names to a newly-formed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
union. Under these circumstances it is not surprising that
women, especially in the worst paid trades, are afraid to
join a trade union, and that even after joining they readily
fall away from an undertaking which may possibly involve
so serious a risk. If working women throughout the country
were dominated by this fear the cause of unionism would
be hopeless; but fortunately this is not the case, and
we can only admire the courage which enables women
earning a miserable pittance to risk its loss by identifying
themselves with an unpopular movement. If the union
were strong it would of course set its face against arbitrary
dismissals, which are in themselves a powerful argument in
favour of organisation; but the difficulty is to prevent their
occurrence during the early years of the union. On this
account it is useful, where possible, to collect a fund for the
relief of women who may be temporarily thrown out of work
owing to their active connection with a trade union; and
the knowledge that such a fund exists helps in itself to
prevent the occasion for its employment arising. The
general public has little idea of the extent to which unscrupulous
employers take advantage of the helpless position
of working women. So widely separated are classes in this
country that a man may grind the faces of the poor and
pass for a saint among those of his own class. An employer
remarked recently to a friend who was advocating unions
for women that they were not necessary in his factory, as
the women had already a fund to which they subscribed.
Further questioning elicited the fact that the “fund” was
derived from fines wrung from the women, and was managed
entirely by the employers. The firm is known for zeal and
munificence in connection with religious bodies, and the
case is by no means an isolated one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>It is impossible to read the Report of the Lady Assistant
Commissioners without becoming convinced that combination
is absolutely necessary, if working women are to secure
a reasonable modification of the scandalous fines and
deductions to which their wages are subjected. The extent
to which these iniquities prevail is now fully revealed for
the first time, and if the unions could attack this one point
alone with success they would have done much to raise the
economic status of working women.</p>

<p><b>Attitude of Men’s Unions.</b>&mdash;Much may be hoped
for the future of unionism among women, from the increased
support which it receives from the leaders of men’s
unions; indeed, it is not too much to say that herein lies
the key to the position. It has often been cast in the
teeth of Trades Unionists that while struggling for freedom
for themselves they have regarded with indifference the
economic position of their working sisters, and have
exerted their influence rather for the restriction of women’s
labour than for the improvement of its conditions. It
is a question, however, whether unionism in its early years,
struggling hard to maintain its existence, could have
undertaken the additional burden of organising the
women. Sometimes the objections raised to women’s
work were exceedingly flimsy, and it is small credit to
a section of working men that they have shown themselves
ready to raise the cry of impropriety, and even immorality,
against women upon grounds which cannot bear the test of
examination. Even were the conditions of women’s work
such as ought not to be tolerated (and no one who knows
the facts would say that this is never the case), the true
cure lies in the formation of unions among the women,
since one of the first things which a strong union would do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
is to stand out for decent arrangements and reasonable
conditions of work. The general public often joins in and
swells the cry against some particular employment for
women, instead of casting about to see if its defects
cannot be remedied. Thus, when the agitation was raised
a few years ago against the employment of women at the
pit brows in Lancashire, the charge of immorality was most
unjustly raised against them, and even their peculiar but
necessary costume was made the ground of serious indictments.
The force expended upon this agitation might, if
more wisely directed, have secured for the women improved
arrangements for their comfort, which in some cases were
much needed; but nobody thought of this. Wider views,
however, are now beginning to prevail, and the generous
support which is given to the claims of women by the
responsible leaders of working men may be expected
gradually to disarm the hostility which undoubtedly exists
among a section of their class.</p>

<p>Of late years Trades Councils have repeatedly come
forward with both money and personal help to organise
the labour of women&mdash;notably the Councils of Aberdeen,
Liverpool, Oldham, Huddersfield, Leicester, and the Midland
Counties Trades Federation. The Manchester and
Salford Trades Council has also taken the matter up, and
is engaged upon a systematic attempt to organise the
female labour of the district. The result of the experiment
will be watched with interest.</p>

<p><b>Results Established.</b>&mdash;The history of unionism
among women, brief though it be, may claim to have
established the following points:</p>

<p>(1) That unions can be formed and carried on upon a firm
financial basis even in trades in which wages are very low.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>(2) That the demands of a trade union are often
sufficient to secure for the workers a rise in wages or
equivalent advantages, such as shorter hours or the
abolition of fines. Miss Collet, in her report of the
Liverpool district, mentions a union of tailoresses which
succeeded in obtaining a shortening of eleven hours in
the working week. In the lace trade Miss Abraham notes
that “In two instances where fines seem to have been
heavy, the formation of a trade union among the workers
has had the effect of checking the system.” Many other
examples might be given.</p>

<p>(3) That unless unions are established, wages, especially
in the less-skilled trades, tend to fall. The competition
of one employer against another is generally sufficient in
itself to bring about this result, unless the workers oppose
a solid front to the pressure from above. The older
members of badly-paid trades know this well, and it is
among them that the keenest advocates of combination
are found.</p>

<p><b>Factory and Home Work.</b>&mdash;Trades carried on
wholly in factories have hitherto proved the most amenable
to combination. Low wages and irregular employment,
though sufficiently serious obstacles, are not so prejudicial
as the division of a trade into factory and home work,
or the existence of domestic workshops. In those of
Cradley Heath, near Birmingham, the isolation of the
workers keeps down wages, and the home, instead of being
saved by the workshop, as some would have us believe,
is, upon the testimony of Miss Orme, Senior Assistant
Commissioner, almost always “desolate.” Where work is
done wholly at home it is difficult to bring influence to
bear upon the women to induce them to combine, and yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
it is here that combination is most necessary, since the
workers have neither the support of companionship nor the
protection of the Factory Acts. With regard to domestic
workshops, it seems probable that legislation will in time
bring these irregular divisions of the labour army into line
with the main body. The first step has already been
taken in the regulation which compels employers to post
up a list of their outworkers. All progress in this direction
is an aid to combination. In the joint influence of legislation
and unionism, aided where necessary by a more efficient
system of inspection, lies the chief hope of improvement in
the less fortunate branches of labour.</p>

<p>An evil which appears to belong exclusively to women’s
labour is the custom, prevalent among girls whose parents
are fairly well off, of working for pocket-money. Even
where the parents are poor the cheapness of boarding at
home often induces girls to work for a rate of wages which
would be cruelly low for those who have to maintain themselves
entirely. Miss Collet’s report to the Labour Commission
lays great stress on this point. In Bristol, girls
working in a cigar factory often earn no more than 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
or 9<i>s.</i> a week, pay 4<i>s.</i> or 5<i>s.</i> to their parents for weekly
board, and seem “quite content” with their low wages.
The disastrous effect of this policy upon the general
standard of women’s wages needs no explanation. It is
sufficient to point out here that the practice forms a serious
obstacle to successful combination among women.</p>

<p><b>Foreign Competition.</b>&mdash;Foreign competition is often
advanced as an argument against raising wages, and it
cannot be denied that in some cases it has force. It is
safe, however, to say that there is little warrant for its
employment in wholesale condemnation of attempts to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
raise wages in the worst-paid trades. We are told, for
instance, that matches made in the east end of London
are undersold by the still cheaper products of Sweden; yet
match factories often pay high dividends, and it is well
known that the profits in a trade bear little relation as
a rule to the rate of wages paid to the workers. It is
generally found that where work is concentrated in large
factories under employers possessed of considerable capital
fair wages are obtainable, and the wretched rate of payment
which prevails in many of the East London trades is probably
due more than is supposed to the hole-and-corner
manner in which the business is carried on. Where foreign
competition is not pressing, the necessity for producing
cheap goods is often urged as a valid reason for abstaining
from any efforts to secure reasonable wages for the producers.
Desirable, however, as cheapness may be, it is
possible to purchase its advantages too dearly. If the
effect of combination among workers were to be a rise in
the price of matches, slop clothing, or fancy boxes, the
consumer would have little cause of complaint, and would
soon acquiesce philosophically in the altered condition of
things. Nor can purchasers, however well disposed toward
the working classes, effect any change on their own account.
Such devices as a “Consumers’ League,” whose members
would bind themselves to deal only with firms paying a
fair rate of wages, must obviously fail, or if conceivably
successful must do as much harm as good until our means
of obtaining information are much more perfect than they
are at present. No such rough-and-ready way of forcing
on reforms is of the slightest use; the workers themselves
must improve their condition by slow and patient effort.
Outsiders may aid and stimulate, but they cannot do the
work.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Centres of Textile Industry.</b>&mdash;By far the largest
demand for women’s labour, next to household service,
comes from the textile industry; and it is in Lancashire,
Cheshire, and Yorkshire, where the cotton and woollen
trades are carried on, that women’s labour under the
Factory system can best be studied. There are several
departments of the textile trades, such as the silk industry,
crape manufacturing, and carpet making, in which women
are also largely employed; but it is in the great cotton
mills of Rochdale, Oldham, Burnley, and Blackburn, the
woollen mills of Huddersfield and Dewsbury, and the
worsted mills of Bradford, that the great majority of women
are to be found.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Changes in General Conditions.</b>&mdash;The grievances
of the women and children employed in the mills in the
cotton trade were the subject of general discussion fifty
years ago, and it was the exposure of the terrible conditions
under which they worked, the excessive hours, the
insanitary conditions, and their complete helplessness,
that forced the hand of the various governments of the
day, and enabled Lord Ashley to introduce his factory
legislation. Since that time the country has heard but
little of the lot of the mill operatives, but from time to time
it appears that all is not as it should be. For instance,
evidence was laid before the Labour Commission which
shewed that the currently-accepted picture of the prosperity
and comfort of the mill operatives was much too highly
coloured. The representatives both of the women and
of the men brought forward a mass of evidence shewing
that the grievances to which the workpeople were
exposed were of the most real and vital kind. The wages
in certain districts and departments might be good, but
the over-driving, the speeding up of machinery, the high
temperature maintained in the mills, the utterly inadequate
provision made for the health of the workpeople, and the
prevalence of fines, all pointed to the conclusion that the
factory legislation contemplated by Lord Ashley and his
successors, and followed up from time to time almost to
the present moment, presented no finality. The conditions
of labour have, it is true, been transformed since those
early days when we read of the operatives’ deputation to
Lord Palmerston. In order to demonstrate that working
a mule was not an easy matter the operatives induced the
Prime Minister to push a chair up and down the room in
imitation of a spinner’s motions. The hours of labour have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
been shortened, but the intensity of labour has increased
at an even higher rate. The strain upon the muscle and
bodily strength may be less, but the nervous wear and tear,
the mental strain, the storm and stress of the mill, have
been also steadily increasing. The history of the troubles
of the Lancashire and Yorkshire operative is not then a
closed chapter; for that matter no department of industry
in these days is or can be. Changes and improvements in
manufacturing processes and machinery are so constant
and sweeping that the worker is ever face to face with new
problems, many of which, indeed, are directly due to the
rising standard of his own life.</p>

<p><b>Extent of Combination.</b>&mdash;Whilst Lancashire and
Yorkshire afford the most instructive field for studying the
influence of factory legislation upon labour, the information
that may be gleaned there respecting combination as an
element in the economic and social life of women is no less
instructive. Side by side with one another you find two
great kindred industries&mdash;the woollen and the cotton&mdash;and
the level of one, so far as women are concerned, is far
below that of the other. No explanation based on competition,
either in commercial or labour markets, can account
for this difference. The explanation must be sought, not in
the ability of the individual or the working of the market,
but in the extent and direction of the combination which
exists among the operatives. It is certain that the operatives
of Lancashire and Cheshire have shewn themselves far
more alive to the benefits of combination than those of
Yorkshire. The worker in the cotton mill, whether male
or female, is a Trade Unionist almost as a matter of course,
and though, as in the best organized of trades, a certain
number still remain outside the pale of the union, those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
who are inside are sufficiently strong, both in numbers and
in practical effectiveness, to formulate the labour policy of
the trade. There is a wide difference between formulating
a policy and carrying it out in practice, but the organizations
of the spinners, weavers, and cardroom-workers have been
successful in making the two very nearly synonymous.
Their leaders have been fully alive to the absurdity of
attempting to carry through an heroic policy in the absence
of effective co-operation on the part of the majority. To
ignore the women workers would have been fatal in an
industry which numbers them by tens of thousands.
Accordingly the policy of the Unionists has been to bring
men and women together into the same organization; to
treat their labour as one and the same; and to provide
equal rules for the remuneration and protection of all.
The most notable result has been that women weavers in
the cotton trade are paid precisely the same wages as the
men; though indeed the fact is scarcely second in importance
that the co-operation of the women workers in every
branch of the cotton industry is absolutely secured for
every trade movement.</p>

<p>The Northern Counties Weavers’ Association numbers
71,180 members, and of these 43,000 are women and
28,180 men; whilst the Card and Blowing-room Operatives’
Organization with its 35,000 members has 14,000 men and
21,000 women enrolled. There are no women in the
Amalgamated Association of Operative Cotton Spinners,
but by the federal arrangement I have referred to, on large
questions of trade policy, and even of state policy, where
the interests of the cotton trade are touched, men and
women spinners, cardroom-workers, and weavers, every
component part of the labour of the cotton trade, may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
counted upon to “go solid.” Although the men are in a
minority in these unions they have not as yet seen their
way to giving any considerable share of the control to the
women, and the managing bodies consist almost exclusively
of men. The fact that women have made no move for
representation would serve to show that their interests have
been well guarded by the various executive bodies. Nor
does there appear to be any jealousy or friction between
the men and women in the Cotton Trade. Mr. Mullen,
Secretary of the Cardroom-workers’ Organization, giving
evidence before the Labour Commission, spoke emphatically
on this point, and what he said is equally true of other
departments where men and women are employed together.
It seems obvious indeed that where absolutely equal
conditions are claimed, and can be maintained, for both
sexes, the causes of ill-feeling and disagreement are removed,
inasmuch as the fatal element of competition between men
and women is no longer at work.</p>

<p><b>Contrast between Yorkshire and Lancashire.</b>&mdash;At
any rate we have not the extraordinary anomaly which
the woollen trade shews, of work precisely similar in kind,
and almost equal in quantity, being blacklisted, as it were,
because it is done by women. I have before me a document
entitled “Huddersfield Woollen Manufacturers’ and Spinners’
Association&mdash;Amended Weaving Scale,” in which the
piece-work prices for men and women respectively are given.
The men have a table upon one side, and upon an
opposite side it is indicated under the heading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span> “Women.
15 per cent. to be deducted from men’s scale for woollens
and cotton warps reversibles. 20 per cent. to be deducted
from men’s scale for white-vested worsted mixture, or solid
coloured worsteds and woollen shawls. 25 per cent. to be
deducted from men’s scale for single white worsteds. 30
per cent. to be deducted from men’s scale for serges
and cotton warps. 15 per cent. to be deducted from
men’s scale for coloured worsteds.” The above applies
to looms running fifty picks per minute; for looms
running seventy to eighty picks per minute 50 per
cent. less than men’s scale is to be paid for wages, while in
other cases proportionate deductions are prescribed. For
looms running 110 to 120 picks per minute the rate is
briefly and compendiously set out as one-third of men’s
scale, which is equivalent to a penalty of two-thirds of the
wage. The women, it may be noted, are as skilful and
as rapid workers as the men, only less productive to the
extent of about 2½ per cent., a difference which is accounted
for by the inability of the women to readjust their looms
when out of order. The disparity which is put upon them
has therefore no proportionate foundation in fact. It is a
purely artificial degradation of wages, a system at once
of fining the workers for being women, and of putting
women’s work and claims for an adequate standard of living
at a discount. To thoroughly appreciate what the Unions
of the cotton trade have done it is well to bear in mind
this manner of dealing with women’s labour, which is
habitual in every trade where men and women are jointly
employed. Instances might be multiplied in the woollen
trade. Thus in a large Halifax carpet mill the women’s
wages average 13<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> per week, and the men’s £1 1<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>
for the same work. And in the wool-combing trade of
Bradford the average weekly earnings of the women are
12<i>s.</i> against the men’s 18<i>s.</i></p>

<p>Nor is it only in the matter of wages that the Trade Unions
have been able to do so much for the women operatives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
of Lancashire. There is abundant evidence to shew that
public opinion has been brought to bear by them upon the
administration of the Factory Acts, and that a standard of
factory administration has been brought about through
their agency that could not possibly have been attained
without it. Then again in the matter of fines, with which
I deal more fully later on, the Unions have made themselves
felt. Whilst fining is still far too prevalent in the
cotton factories it is less prevalent and arbitrary than in
the woollen and worsted trades.</p>

<p><b>Supervision.</b>&mdash;But perhaps the question which touches
women most closely is the nature of the supervision to
which they are subjected. Unhappily this has sometimes
been of the lowest kind. Not only have bullying
expedients been used for the purpose of “driving” the
workpeople&mdash;for instance, by exposing the names of
those who had fallen below the standard of the labour
driver in the shed&mdash;but immoral conduct has had to be
submitted to. However, the Unions have taken a firm
attitude in this latter respect, and indeed two strikes have
recently taken place, one at Oldham and one at Nelson,
with the result that in each case the obnoxious overlooker
was removed. In the Nelson case the evidence was
submitted to arbitrators, clergymen of the neighbourhood,
who, in giving their judgment, placed it on record that the
offences of which the man had been judged guilty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span> “are
not uncommon among men who have the oversight of the
female operatives in other mills, and as ministers of religion
we most earnestly appeal to the employers of labour
practically to recognise their duty in this matter, and
seriously consider how essential it is to the happiness and
well-being of those under their charge, as well as to their
credit, to make the moral conduct of their workpeople the
subject of nearer concern and of greater importance.” It
is satisfactory to note that this award has created an
improvement in the behaviour of overlookers generally,
and has attracted the attention of employers.</p>

<p><b>Fines.</b>&mdash;The system of fines is deeply felt and bitterly
resented. The fines may be divided generally into two
classes; namely, disciplinary, and those inflicted on account
of damage done to the work. Under the first head are
included fines for late attendance in starting work, and in
returning to the mill after meal hours; being found in the
wrong shed or room; laughing, sitting down, etc. Fines
for late attendance range as a rule from 1<i>d.</i> for the first five
minutes lost up to 3<i>d.</i> and 6<i>d.</i> according to the time lost;
other disciplinary fines from 6<i>d.</i> to 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> The deductions
made for damages of various kinds are even a more serious
matter. After the work leaves the loom it is examined and
passed, and if any flaw is found in it the weaver is liable
to have the piece returned with the intimation that she
must buy it, or submit to a heavy deduction. In many
cases the fines imposed amount to the wages earned upon
the piece. The injustices incident to such a system&mdash;if
system it can be called where no rule obtains&mdash;are many.
In the first place it gives an immense power into the hands
of the overlooker or cloth looker who examines the work,
and this power is often abused. Then again it enables the
employers to shift from themselves to the workpeople the
loss sustained by the use of bad material. The system of
piece-work itself accomplishes this, as the worse the material
the longer and more troublesome the job, and the less the
wages. But in addition to this the worker’s own time has to
be lost in “mending,” and wages are deducted for mistakes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
which no amount of watchfulness or skill could avert.
Frequently too the operatives are not even shewn the piece
on account of which the fine is imposed. The “Particulars
Clause,” which was inserted in the Factory Act of 1891, had
mainly its origin in what amounted to a fraudulent system
of deductions. The system is somewhat too technical for
explanation here, but it consists in giving weavers and
other textile piece workers a false basis on which to calculate
the amount of work done, so that the wages paid to
them fall short of what they are entitled to receive. It is
now compulsory upon employers to furnish to certain
classes of operatives particulars of piece-work&mdash;another
instance in which Trade Unionism has suggested legislation,
for the clause is entirely due to the influence of the
Textile Unions.</p>

<p>Among other forms of deduction are charges made for
the use of hot water, the oiling of looms, the renewal and
repair of brushes and oil cans, and the cleaning out of
lavatories. I have known mills in which the system of
fines has been purely nominal; but unfortunately these
constitute a minority, the rule being that the workpeople
have to ensure the employer out of their own wages against
all risks and damage in the process of production, whether
due to defects in material, machinery, or workmanship.</p>

<p><b>Sanitation.</b>&mdash;Although the Factory Acts have been
in operation for several years, the lamentable conditions
to which reference has been made in passing can scarcely
be said to have been seriously grappled with. It is necessary
to distinguish between the conditions which attach to
the work-place, and those which are due to the nature of
the work itself. I have therefore considered them apart
from one another. There is abundant evidence to shew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
that throughout the textile trades operatives are exposed in
a very grave degree to evils arising from defective sanitary
arrangements. In the majority of mills the sanitary
arrangements are most unsatisfactory, both from the point
of view of health and decency. Evidence collected on
this head by the Labour Commission leaves no doubt
whatever upon the matter. Whether it is due to negligence,
or ignorance, or both, the fact remains that, tried by the lowest
standard, the sanitary arrangements are grossly defective.
This part of the subject cannot be left without remarking
upon the altogether lower level of public health administration
existing inside the factory than that which is maintained
outside. We must deal with remedies later on, but
the lack of symmetry and co-ordination in our public health
system stands out so glaringly in this particular as to call
for some notice here. Dealing with ventilation, it is equally
evident that the mills have been designed entirely without
reference to the workers. The consequence is, that where
ventilation exists it is often of the most haphazard description.
Everything is subordinated to the purposes of
manufacture, and however vigilant and efficient a factory
inspector may be, it is often impossible to arrange in
existing buildings for the proper renewal of air.</p>

<p><b>High Temperature in Cotton Mills.</b>&mdash;With regard
to temperature and atmosphere the woollen worker is
better off than the cotton worker. The practice of
sizing the cotton has led to the introduction of excessive
heat and steam for the purpose of softening the
fabric during the process of weaving. It was to check
this that the Cotton Cloth Act was introduced; but,
although a certain standard has now been laid down, the
operatives are still exposed to very injurious influences.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
In many of the weaving sheds the temperature stands at
90°, whilst steam jets are to be found within a few inches
of the weavers’ heads. Cotton weavers suffer in consequence
from diseases of the chest brought about by the sudden
change from the hot, humid atmosphere to the outside air.
Rheumatism is also general, and cases of fainting are not
uncommon among the workers in these mills. But even
where there is no artificial production of a bad atmosphere,
there always exists the natural deterioration induced by the
presence of large numbers of workpeople penned together
with a great mass of machinery. The great heat and
exhaustion of air, the constant showers of fibrous dust
given off by the fabric in course of construction, are
elements which call for a strenuous counterblast in the
shape of abundant fresh air. In the chapter upon diseases
of occupation fuller reference is made to these matters.</p>

<p><b>Dangerous Machinery.</b>&mdash;Much has been done to
secure the protection of dangerous machinery, but accidents
caused by flying shuttles are still far too frequent, and are
sometimes attended by the most distressing results. In
eighteen recent shuttle accidents the loss of an eye has
ensued. This is a risk which is quite preventable by the
adoption of a shuttle-guard. But the matter is left to the
option of employers, and guards are not in general use.</p>

<p><b>Labour of Married Women.</b>&mdash;There are other
sacrifices demanded of the women who work in the textile
trades besides those which can be directly connected with
their work. I am aware that many of the workers themselves
do not look upon their employment in this light.
An abundant demand for labour in which women can participate
is generally regarded as a great boon; but against
the advantages must be set the drawbacks&mdash;the comparative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
break-up of home life and the habitual neglect
of children. The problem is a grave one, and opinions
are conflicting, but most people agree that something
should be done at any rate to arrest the terrible infant
mortality, which is to be found in all the centres which give
widespread employment for married women. It is urged
that it is impossible to legislate for comfortable homes, and
that the direct prohibition of the labour of those whose
homes should be their first charge is also impossible, but
that yet some improvement is necessary, and can, by more
moderate measures, be secured. We certainly cannot afford&mdash;the
manufacturers themselves cannot afford&mdash;to have
generation after generation sapped of its strength, and
thrown upon life unfitted for its tasks. And much also may
be said as to the doubtful economy of the mother’s supplementary
wage. It may sometimes be the means of adding
to the family income, but cases have come under my
notice in which the weekly payments made for looking
after the home and children, the extra expenses involved in
mending and in washing and in the preparation of food,
outweigh the gain in wages. Then again the payments
for doctors and medicine are higher in families where the
mother works at the mill, and the children are left to themselves,
than in those where the children are constantly
under a mother’s care. If in addition to this we remember
the tendency of women’s labour to pull down the general
standard of remuneration, it is apparent that we must not
hasten to accept the conclusion that the prohibition of the
labour of married women, either partially or entirely, would
mean the impoverishment of the family.</p>

<p><b>Child Labour.</b>&mdash;Much attention has been given to
the age of admission of children to work in the textile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
trades. At the Berlin Conference twelve was fixed as a
sort of international minimum at which children should be
allowed to enter upon factory labour. The age fixed by
the British factory legislation of that time was ten for half-timers
and fourteen for full-timers, or thirteen if the child
had passed the prescribed educational standard. Our representatives,
however, with the concurrence of the Government,
endorsed the proposal for raising the age to twelve. When
however the Factory Act of 1891 was being passed through
the House of Commons, the opposition of Lancashire and
Yorkshire overcame the good intentions of the Government.
Instead of proposing to raise the age to twelve, they refused
to alter the then existing law, with the result that they were
beaten on Mr. Sydney Buxton’s amendment to raise the
age to eleven. And most people&mdash;except of course directly
interested parents and employers&mdash;who are acquainted with
the unhealthy surroundings of mill life, are of opinion that
eleven is too young an age at which to begin work, even as
a half-timer. It is true that the certifying surgeon is
empowered by the Factory Act to refuse a certificate to any
child who appears to him to be from physical causes unfit
for work; but the children are only submitted for examination
once, either upon, or immediately after beginning work,
so that their fitness for employment must therefore be more
or less a matter of speculation. They are not again
examined till they have become “young persons,” and a
certain number whose employers manage to evade the law
are never examined at all.</p>

<p><b>Other Textile Trades.</b>&mdash;The other branches of the
textile trades, and the other districts in which those already
referred to exist, are, with the exception of the linen trade,
comparatively unimportant. Of those in the woollen-cloth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
trade, or such of it as still survives in the West of England,
we find women who work in the factories at Trowbridge
and Stroud earning about two-thirds of the wages of the
Yorkshire women. There is no effective combination either
amongst the men or the women. Wages have been fixed by
custom, and they scarcely ever fluctuate. The low-water mark
of factory wages is to be found in the Essex crape industry,
where the women are in receipt of about 5<i>s.</i> a week.</p>

<p>The silk trade is carried on mostly at Macclesfield
and Leek. The wages earned by women vary according
to the districts and employers. They are for the most
part very low; and as employment in the silk trade is
more intermittent than in any other textile industry, the
average wages per week for the year are miserably low. In
the silk-throwing trade of Macclesfield they amount to
about 6<i>s.</i> a week if calculated throughout the year. Women
working power looms can command about 12<i>s.</i> a week
during the good season. Taking the various departments
together, the average wages in Leek are 11<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, Derby 10<i>s.</i>,
and Congleton 7<i>s.</i> In Coventry, which is the principal
centre of ribbon weaving, much of the work is done by
outdoor weavers; their looms are driven by an engine which
supplies the power to each block of houses. The weaver
owns the loom and pays rent for house and power together
at the rate of about 10<i>s.</i> per week; home workers are able
to command better prices than the factory workers.</p>

<p>In the carpet manufacture, of which Kidderminster is
the centre, a large number of women are employed, the
wages ranging from 6<i>s.</i> a week for the simplest work to
14<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> for the more difficult. Men are employed in the
heaviest work and in the most skilled departments, and they
have been able to resist the introduction of women’s labour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
Fourteen years ago an attempt was made to introduce
women at the same wages as those paid in Yorkshire,
about 15<i>s.</i> a week, but the men held their ground, and
still retain the old standard of 35<i>s.</i></p>

<p>The hosiery and lace trades, which are carried on
in Nottinghamshire and Leicestershire, give employment
to several thousand women. There is no standard rate of
wages in Nottingham; the small firms pay lower wages
than the large ones, whilst in the adjoining country
districts the rates are considerably lower than in Nottingham.
A great deal of finishing work is given out by
middlemen to people in these districts, and is paid for
at a very low rate.</p>

<p>The lace trade is characterised by extreme irregularity
of employment. Wages range from 4<i>s.</i> a week for
“dressing” lace to 24<i>s.</i> for making it up. A quantity of
work which was formerly done inside the factories is now
given out, with the result that prices have dropped heavily.
As in the hosiery trade, the sanitation and ventilation of
the factories vary very greatly. No standard appears to be
recognized or enforced, and as is the case in so many other
industries, a few employers have spared no trouble or expense
to ensure the health and comfort of their workpeople,
whilst the majority have done little or nothing.</p>

<p>Belfast may claim to be the centre of the linen trade,
which finds habitation as well throughout the north of
Ireland, and in the little Scotch towns of Forfar, Brechin,
and Dunfermline. But in Scotland the linen industry
and the jute industry are largely carried on together,
whilst in Belfast the linen trade almost unsupplemented
holds the field, and provides work for nearly 30,000
girls and women. The processes of manufacture closely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
resemble those of the cotton industry, but the wages are
much lower, the unhealthy conditions far more marked,
the protective agencies supplied by the workers themselves
in the shape of trade unions altogether wanting, and a
law similar to that which regulates the heat and humidity
in the weaving sheds of Lancashire non-existent.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>It is extremely difficult to give the actual wages earned,
for although the supply of employment is usually regular,
much loss of time is occasioned by the exhausting and
unhealthy nature of the work, and a considerable lessening
of wages is consequent upon the deductions and penalties
which are enforced. Thus if a woman loses half a day
she is deprived of half her bonus, whilst the loss of a
whole day means the disappearance of the bonus altogether.
This so-called bonus on regular employment is really a part
of the time wages of the workers. In most of the factories
and mills it is 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, in some 1<i>s.</i> a week. As it is exceptional
for a woman to be able to work the whole week
through, this bonus rarely finds its way in its integrity into
her pocket. In addition to this there are fines and
deductions for damaged work, just as there are in the
cotton and woollen industries. Taking all this into
account, the average wages of the women can scarcely
amount to more than 8<i>s.</i> or 9<i>s.</i> a week. Further reference
is made to the grossly insanitary condition of the trade
and the mills in another chapter. So far no labour movements
on the part of the women have ever had the slightest
success. The employers have been in the habit of meeting
any movements of the kind by the threat of a lock-out,
which has been carried into effect more than once.</p>

<p><b>Machinery and Women’s Labour.</b>&mdash;We have seen
that in the textile trades men and women do the same kind
of work, and are almost equally skilled. Where their
labour is organised they can also in some districts command
the same rate of payment; but it is certainly true that in
most trades which have opened their doors to women, the
idea on the employer’s part has been to secure a supply of
cheaper labour than could be obtained if men alone were
to be relied upon, and to break down the male monopoly.
While this may not form a conscious and distinct motive
on the part of employers, it is obvious that the intense
sub-division and specialisation of manufacturing processes
has made it possible as time has gone on to dispense more
and more with trained and skilled labour, and to call in
women and children who, with a little practice, could soon
adapt themselves to the work. The more labour has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
become impersonal, the more the machine has produced
both the muscular energy and the manual skill which were
once purely human in their origin, the simpler has the
labour question become from the manufacturer’s point of
view. “If,” he says to himself, “my machine, on which I
have laid out so much capital, and which represents the
ingenuity and the experiments of long years of labour, can
perform all the movements of the human body a thousand
times more swiftly and surely; if my machine does the
working and the thinking, it is not likely that I am going
to pay the people who watch and tend it as though they did
all the work.” It is in those industrial departments where the
human processes are most mechanical and lend themselves
after a short training to almost automatic performance,
that the field of women’s labour under the factory system
for the most part lies. All those who are at all conversant
with the movements of industry and mechanical invention
will be able to call to mind examples in point. Of course
the same process is taking place where men only are employed.
The skilled artizan has become less of a necessity as
the skilled machine becomes more common; and, on the
other hand, the unskilled labourer, the man who does the
rough lifting, hewing, and carrying work is becoming more
of a mechanic, as the mechanical stone-breaker, the steam
navvy, the grain elevator, and other contrivances of the
kind, come into use. Now, while we have these two sets of
forces at work, one superseding the muscular energy, and
the other the manual skill and the mental training, the
bearing of these tendencies upon women’s employment
cannot be overlooked. It seems only reasonable to suppose
that the demand for women’s labour in connection with
mechanical industry will become greater and greater as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
work becomes simpler and lighter; whilst masculine labour,
in so far as it stands for special aptitude and skill, is likely
to find itself in less request, and may have to submit to
accepting a lower standard of remuneration fixed by women.
The movement of labour in the United States, as well as in
this country, tends to confirm this view.</p>

<p><b>The Sweating System.</b>&mdash;Attention, perhaps, has
been too much fixed upon certain incidents of the
evolution of industry which, though important, are, as
it were, branch lines, to have fully grasped the real
economical trend of events. Amongst these is what is
known as the sweating system. But the sweating system
is, after all, but a kind of guerilla warfare carried on upon the
flanks of the main engagement. You find it at its height
in certain exceptional communities like London, where the
cost of rent is so heavy as to make it more economical for
the employer to let the worker pay the rent instead of
himself. Again, the accumulation of human beings in a
great centre like London is so vast that the purchaser of
labour is in a position to compete with machinery without
standing to lose. This is why the human pressure becomes
so intolerable. It is a race in which the individual has to
compete against organisation and machinery&mdash;usually under
the most depressing conditions&mdash;in which the worker,
without receiving any equivalent, carries a large responsibility,
which, under organised industry, is discharged by
the employer. It is only necessary to compare some great
clothing factory where the sewing machines are driven by
machinery, and work goes on in a well-lighted and airy
building for a fixed number of hours daily at a fixed scale
of payment, with the dirty and cramped rooms in Whitechapel
or Stepney, which are rendered comfortless as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
home by being turned into a workshop, in which a
ruinous price is paid for the sewing machine bought on the
hire system, and where there are no regular hours of work,
but alternations of high pressure and protracted idleness,
and finally where the rate of payment is a matter for
constant haggling between the unfortunate worker and
the middleman who gives out the clothes from the
City warehouse to be made up&mdash;you have only to compare
these two methods of industry to realise the real
nature of the struggle, and the intolerable pressure to
which the victim of high rents, abnormal density of
population, and correspondingly low standard of equipment
is subjected.</p>

<p>The conclusions to be drawn from this brief survey
seem to me to be not unimportant. In the first place,
it is because labour has become so much lighter, and
trades so much more easily learned, that the demand
for women’s labour has grown so immensely of late years;
in the second place, machinery, the great leveller, is
tending to abolish rapidly such differences as have
existed between men’s and women’s labour; and, in
the third place, that whether legislation or organisation
be attempted in the interests of the workers, it must
embrace men and women alike.</p>

<p><b>Basis of Men’s and Women’s Wages.</b>&mdash;But
another condition which faces one at every turn of the
labour market, goes so far to differentiate the work of
men and women, that it may seem to make all the
levelling influences which we have just considered of no
account. In the case of men wages are based upon
the cost of living. They approximate to a man’s standard of
existence and that of his family for the time being.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
With the woman worker, on the other hand, though
there are exceptions, the rule is that her wages are of a
supplementary character. If she can add something to
the nett weekly takings of the family, that is the chief
point. The daughter, who is apprenticed to the dressmaker
or milliner, or who begins life as a half-timer in
the mills, is not working for her living in the same way
as the man who has to provide himself with an independence;
and it is obvious that this factor, modified as it
is by all the variations of the standard of family living
in different parts of the country, must be at the bottom
of much that is confusing, arbitrary, and inexplicable in
the women’s labour movement. For instance, cases are
constantly to be found of a different scale of payment for
men and women for the same work. Thus, in the French-polishing,
printing, and many other trades, women are
paid on a lower scale at piece-work than men. We find
that the average value of a woman’s work is 9<i>s.</i> or 10<i>s.</i>
a week, while that of a man is two or three times as high.
It is not that she does half or one-third as much work,
or that it is to that extent inferior in quality to men’s
work: the reason, I think, must in very many cases be
looked for from the domestic side. A woman considers
what it will be worth while to add to the family revenue,
rather than what her work is really worth. This fact
more than anything else accounts for the immense difficulties
of introducing order and humanity into the field
of woman’s labour; for, obviously, if the woman worker
is to acquire any form of economic independence she
must be able to earn such a rate of wages as will
enable her to maintain a decent standard of subsistence.
But this is rendered impossible so long as the effective<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
remuneration of women’s work is decided by conditions
other than those which properly attach to the work. With
some girls working for pocket-money, others literally exploited
by their parents, and regarded as a mere means of
bringing grist to the mill; others again working to lay by
something to get married on, and a further great section
of wives toiling to add something to their husbands’ wages;
it is only too clear that the economic independence of
women, which the advocates of <i>laisser faire</i> in women’s
labour hope to bring about, is very, very far from being
accomplished.</p>

<p>These conditions make it extremely unsafe to attempt
generalizations as to the wages earned by women in the
various industries. There are, however, certain fairly well-defined
groups of trades, having wage features in common,
at which it will be interesting to glance. I will take first
the trades&mdash;very few in number&mdash;where women are organized.
Chief of these is the cotton industry; and here
we find that where men and women do the same work
they receive, with a few unimportant exceptions, the same
wages. The payment for weavers, men or women, is fixed
according to the length and character of the piece of material,
and the looms are calculated to earn a certain sum for
a full day’s work according to their size and speed. The
earnings, therefore, vary with the time worked; but it is
quite a common thing for a woman weaver to earn 24<i>s.</i> a
week all the year round. With spinners the case is different.
The mule spinners are men, and earn about 35<i>s.</i> a week.
The wages of ring and throstle spinners&mdash;women&mdash;rarely
come to more than 14<i>s.</i> or 15<i>s.</i> This kind of spinning
has, in some cases, displaced mule spinning, but only to
a slight extent, as it is not available for all varieties of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
material. The women and girls in the cardroom departments
earn about 18<i>s.</i> and 20<i>s.</i>, warpers about the same,
and winders rather less. These rates may be compared
with those in the Yorkshire textile trade, where the workers’
organization is less powerful, and consequently, in many
cases, women are paid at a considerably lower rate than
men for similar work. This is markedly the case with
the Huddersfield weavers; also with the wool-combers at
Bradford, where women earn 12<i>s.</i> for work at which men
make 18<i>s.</i> The Yorkshire weavers’ wages are in some
cases as low as 8<i>s.</i> or 9<i>s.</i> a week, and seldom average more
than 18<i>s.</i> A common plan is to calculate all wages on a
“women’s scale,” and pay the men so much extra for the
piece. The women in the Yorkshire textile trade, on the
whole, do not appear to be in any better position than
the ordinary class of unorganized female factory workers.
In the West of England cloth districts wages are even
lower than in Yorkshire; for a weaver earns only from 7<i>s.</i>
to 14<i>s.</i> a week, taking the wages all the year round. For
a great mass of other factory workers these figures would
represent the usual earnings. Among this class are jam
makers, bookbinders, mineral-water operatives, bottle-washers,
and confectioners. Confectioners generally begin
at 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a week, and the average is about 8<i>s.</i> But in
some trades, or branches of trades, the earnings are still
lower. The silk throwsters of Macclesfield, for instance,
and the Essex crape weavers, make about 6<i>s.</i> a week, and
the tobacco operatives 6<i>s.</i> or 7<i>s.</i> On the other hand,
skilled cigar makers can earn from 18<i>s.</i> to 30<i>s.</i> a week.
And again, some of the Birmingham trades are less badly
paid. The button makers, for example, earn 10<i>s.</i> to 15<i>s.</i>
a week, and in the hosiery, boot and shoe, and lace trades,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
the wages for the more skilled parts of the work are fairly
good, as women’s wages go, in times of full work; though
when the factories are working short time only 3<i>s.</i> or 4<i>s.</i> a
week may be the average. These last trades, which have
their chief seats in Leicester and Nottingham, all suffer from
the competition of underpaid labour in the neighbouring
districts. The hosiery seamer in the factory earns from
11<i>s.</i> to 16<i>s.</i> a week full time; but a home-worker at the
same business may work hard all the week and only make
2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> or 3<i>s.</i> Perhaps the worst paid group of trades is
that in which home-work is the leading feature, such as
shirtmaking, mantle-making, tailoring, matchbox-making.
The earnings are not only low but uncertain, and it is
impossible to make any generalization as to their amount.
There are certain skilled occupations, such as dressmaking
and millinery, in which a superior worker can earn what
are, for women, good wages. A dressmaker will commonly
make from 10<i>s.</i> to £1, and a milliner about the same;
but it must be remembered that there are women and
girls employed in the minor branches of such trades whose
wages are much less, and in provincial towns the superior
workers too are paid on a lower scale. Finally, there are
the women employed in very toilsome, disagreeable, or
dangerous trades, and these are by no means highly paid
when the nature of their work is considered. Laundresses,
in the washing branch of the trade, get 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> or 2<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> a
day, and ironers 3<i>s.</i> to 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, and in all branches of the
laundry trade employment is intermittent. Women are
employed in tinplate works, ironworks, and brickworks,
for 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a week, or little more, and white-lead workers’
wages are often only 2<i>s.</i> a day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>§ <b>Difference between Men’s and Women’s wages
artificially kept up.</b>&mdash;To sum up, then, the points we
have been considering;&mdash;whilst there are strong forces at
work tending to abolish the distinctions between men’s
and women’s work and the industrial disabilities to which
women have been subject, such as lack of training and
muscular strength, these very distinctions are still kept up
by the different method of appraising the work performed.
Even though a woman’s work may be as good and as rapid
as a man’s, we have seen that her scale of payment is
frequently far inferior to his. She may be working on the
same kind of machine, speeded at the same pace, turning
out the same commodity, and yet a heavy penalty is laid on
her simply because she is a woman. The experience gained
in the cotton trade, however, seems to shew that in an
industry where machinery is largely employed, and where
the trade organization includes both men and women,
the economic disadvantages under which women labour
tend to disappear.</p>

<p>It would seem, therefore, clearly to be in the true interest
of workmen to promote such legislation and such methods
of organization as will afford to women the same vantage-ground
as men. A good deal of nonsense is talked and
written about men’s unions trampling on women’s labour.
It is not to women’s labour as such that the unions are
opposed; but they know from long experience that labour,
whether it be men’s or women’s, that yields to the slightest
pressure, and whose remuneration is subject to no given
standard of living or efficiency, is the greatest danger that
they could have to meet. To blame men for their action
in trying to apply to women’s labour the conditions which
they have found absolutely essential to their own well-being,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
is really to deny their own organizations any validity. It
seems to me very certain that by resisting the levelling down
which would follow any surrender of the standard of living
as the minimum gauge of wages the men’s unions have
been fighting not only against the degradation of labour
generally, but for a better status for women’s labour.</p>

</div>

<p>§ <b>Economic Importance of Health.</b>&mdash;The economics
of industry from the point of view of wealth have
quite a literature of their own; but the more vital standpoint
of health has been almost entirely overlooked by the
economist, the sociologist, and the physiologist. It is a
singular oversight, for one would have thought that the
conservation of industrial energy was a tolerably important
element in the field of production. But, along with
certain other large assumptions, we seem to have reckoned
upon an inexhaustible supply of labour. It may be considered
somewhat fanciful to assume anything else when
in most trades the supply of labour exceeds the demand,
and machinery increasingly takes the place of physical
labour. The number of the labourers who present themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
is not, however, the only matter for consideration,
the quality of their labour is of the most material importance.
It is a matter of the greatest moment to
secure well-developed and healthy people for the industrial
army.</p>

<p>§ <b>Causes of Ill-health.</b>&mdash;The main causes of industrial
ill-health, which apply equally to men and women,
though with even greater intensity to the latter, may be
classified under two heads;&mdash;causes which are incidental
to the nature of the work itself, and injurious circumstances
connected with its surroundings. Under the first
head would come cases of poisoning from handling or
breathing or absorbing in some way the poisonous
matter given off from material that was being worked
up; the inhalation of “dust”&mdash;a generic term which
may suffice to express an almost infinite variety of
particles of a more or less injurious character generated
in working up textile fabrics and in the various processes
of manufacturing and finishing metallic commodities;
and, thirdly, the contact with noxious gases and vapours
which are encountered in not a few industries. Under
the second head would come all matters connected with
the surroundings of the mill or workshop, such as the
extent to which fresh air is admitted and foul air driven
out, the cleanliness of the workrooms, the extent to which
gas is burned, the heat that has to be faced, whether
from exposure to furnaces, to the hot, moist atmosphere
produced by hot water apparatus, or by machinery, or
from over-crowding. We should have to range more or
less under both heads such incidents of occupation as
sedentariness, or strain and pressure, as these may be
partly inherent in the occupation, and partly the result of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
custom, and therefore not necessarily connected with the
processes of the work to be performed.</p>

<p>But in considering women’s work we have to take into
account not only the immediate effect upon the worker, but
the indirect consequences that may follow from injury to
the system; and here we are brought almost at once into
contact with all the grave questions connected with the
subject of married women’s labour. As to the extent and
gravity of the injuries to health arising from the general
causes indicated, there is no question whatever. The
reader who wishes to ascertain for himself full particulars
as to diseases of occupation cannot do better than read
the work by Dr. Arlidge, in which he breaks the ground on
this immense subject. He will find no less than ninety
occupations specified as dangerous because of the amount
of dust disseminated, and an equally large category of
trades in which the women employed suffer in one way or
another from contact with harmful materials, from emanations,
or from muscular or nervous troubles contracted in
connection with their work.</p>

<p>§ <b>Textile Trades. Cotton.</b>&mdash;If we glance at some
of the processes connected with the textile trades, we shall
be able to form some idea of what their effects are upon
the operatives. The manufacturer in Burnley or Blackburn
who steams his cotton in the weaving of it produces a given
result not only upon the fabric but upon the operative, and
the same statement applies to the process of sizing, of
which steaming is a subsidiary function. Both processes are
entered into for the purpose of weighting the cotton-cloth,
which is sold by the pound. The compound known as size
is made up of chloride and sulphate of zinc in conjunction
with tallow and china clay, and this size dust gets powdered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
over the operatives and finds its way into their lungs. The
temperature often exceeds 90° F. in the weaving sheds,
and the moist heat generated by the jets of steam is
excessively trying. In many weaving sheds the damp
accumulates on the floor and induces rheumatism and
other troubles, and the clothes of the women employed
become saturated. So the adulteration of cotton cloth
carries with it the adulteration of human health and the
break-up of constitutions, and results in consumption,
bronchitis, rheumatism, and general depression of vital
force. Again, in other branches of the textile trades
quantities of fluff and fine fibrous dust are generated, and
the workers must take their chance of its getting into their
lungs. This is especially true of the jute manufacturing
and rope making industries. It is not necessary here to
enter very closely into the technicalities of manufacturing;
everyone will understand that the preliminary processes of
textile work, the “combing” and “carding,” as it is called,
are bound to set free quantities of dust, whilst, later on, the
heat and damp which prevail in much of the spinning and
weaving are the main health factors to be considered. For
those who live out of sight of this great industry, never
hearing the rattle of the clogs over the roads in the early
morning, at the dinner hour, and again when the bell rings
for ceasing work; who only know from passing them in the
train the look of the huge and brilliantly lighted mills, it
may require some effort of imagination to realise the
importance of these matters to the operatives, who for 56½
hours every week are to a greater or lesser extent working
under trying conditions.</p>

<p>§ <b>Children.</b>&mdash;We must not forget too that for half a
week many thousands of young children are working in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
these places exposed to precisely the same conditions; and
besides the half-timers who gravitate between the mill
and the school many children of very tender years spend
the time when their whole future depends upon healthy
conditions from six o’clock in the morning till five o’clock
at night in the mills. If the work is trying for adults,
what must it be for the half-timers and young whole-timers?
On this point Dr. Tarrop, one of the certifying
surgeons, has made some valuable researches, and I give
below his diagnosis of two thousand factory children
examined by him.</p>

<div class="blockquote smaller">

<p>§ <b>Dr. Tarrop’s Report.</b>&mdash;“Of the first two thousand cases noted
1771 may be described as specimens of the ordinary factory child, and
I separate them into three classes&mdash;341 superior, 1106 medium, and
324 distinctly below average. [Lancashire average, <i>nota bene</i>.] As to
the rest of the 2000, 151 were really fine children, of whom twenty-one
were excellent examples of humanity, weighing 130 lbs., 126 lbs., and
120 lbs. respectively. The balance of the 2000&mdash;78 in number&mdash;were
a feeble folk, amongst whom were some eight veritable pigmies, ten
to thirteen years old, and not scaling fifty pound a piece. It must be
borne in mind that the medium average of Lancashire factory
children is not equal to the average elsewhere. The latter standard is
hardly reached by the 341 children described as superior, while the
medium division is greatly below the standard of good health. This is
much more distinctly marked amongst children of thirteen, ‘full-timers,’
who have passed some years in the factory, than it is in those
of ten years of age. Of sixty healthy children, averaging thirteen and
a half years, and taken as they came (thirty-one girls and twenty-nine
boys), the average weight was seventy-four pound, or eighteen pound
below the average of good health elsewhere. The lower division of
324 included many defective and diseased cases, and of course the
seventy-eight residuum were poor indeed. The cases of defective
or diseased children numbered 198.” He appends to these numerical
particulars the observation that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span> “Factory work is not so excessively
laborious, it is the heat, impurity, and dust-laden state of the
atmosphere that injures health. The promising child of ten degenerates
into the lean and sallow person of thirteen, and this progress is
continued until a whole population becomes stunted, and thus the
conditions of life in factory towns become a real source of danger to
England’s future. In addition to the loss of physique it is instructive
to note the deterioration in personal appearance. Out of the 2000
children under notice only sixteen could be described as handsome,
and of these the larger portion were girls from Ireland.”</p>

</div>

<p>§ <b>Linen. Dr. Purdon’s Report.</b>&mdash;The conditions
in the linen trade, the head-quarters of which are at
Belfast, are similar in kind to those in the cotton trade.
Careful inquiries were made nearly twenty years ago by
the late Dr. Purdon, certifying surgeon of Belfast, who
has devoted many years of his life to this investigation.
He states that&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote smaller">

<p>“The skilled operatives amount to 25,759, and out of this number
only five arrive at 70 years, and only one, a weaver, has been working
55 years (hand and power-loom).… Another class, to which I would
draw special attention, is the <i>carders</i>, whose life averages 45·7, and the
average length of time employed as such is only 16·8 years. I may
mention that if a girl gets a card at 18 years, her life is generally terminated
at 30 years.… The next class that suffers greatly from the
pouce is the <i>preparers</i>, and the average time that they work is 28·7
years, and the longest time that any have been employed in the department
is 48 years. I may say that when the workers that are employed
in the unhealthy departments begin to feel that they are suffering from
affections brought on by their employment, they at once select (if they
can) the healthier processes, but the chest disease has already made too
much progress, and their lives are only prolonged for a short time.
The departments generally selected are the weaving, winding, and
reeling. The <i>dressing</i> department is … of special importance. The
room … requires to be kept at a very high temperature, varying from
90 to 120 or 125 according to the character of the fabric. On account
of the great heat, no one under 18 and not free from chest affections is
engaged, and as it is considered that their days are shortened by several
years they are paid very high wages. It is seen from the tables that
the average time of employment is only 16·6 years, and only one has
worked for 30 years; they suffer greatly from the unhealthiness of their
employment. I would recommend in addition to my former recommendations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
that the temperature of the mills should be especially
attended to, and that at three o’clock each day steam fans should be
set on (if the temperature has increased much), as the system that has
been working for so many hours in an atmosphere of so high a temperature
is still further exhausted by an increase of heat as well as by
prolonged labour in the same; and also that males should be employed
at the cards.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">“The Mortality of Flax, Mill, and Factory Workers.</span></p>

<p>“It will be perceived that the flax manufacturing operatives suffer far
more from phthisis and diseases of the respiratory organs than the other
two classes&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> the rest of the artisan and labouring population, and
the gentry and mercantile classes&mdash;nearly three-fifths of those that die
annually being taken off by diseases of the respiratory organs, while in
the other two classes the average amounts to about two-fifths. The
death-rate among those employed in the preparing rooms is exceedingly
high, being thirty-one per thousand; few of those employed in these
rooms live beyond sixty years. The reason that the machine boys
appear to suffer so little is that when they become ‘poucey’&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
asthmatic&mdash;from flax dust, numbers of them leave the mills on account
of suffering from chest affections, and go to other trades, where they
linger out a diseased existence, or die from phthisis, and their deaths

<p>“In the machine and preparing rooms the atmosphere is constantly
loaded with the flax dust called ‘pouce.’ … The irritating quality
of the dust is felt upon the throat, which soon becomes dry. This
irritation gradually creeps into the lungs and produces chronic inflammation
of the lining membrane, which soon manifests its presence by
the worker being attacked each morning with a paroxysm of dyspnœa
and coughing. The dyspnœa is sometimes so great that he takes hold
of the table of the machine in order to enable him to get over the
attack more easily. This state is so well known that when a worker is
seen suffering so he is said to be ‘poucey.’ Those employed in the
roughing, sorting, hackling, and preparing of flax suffer from this
affection, and in the great majority of cases die from phthisis, &amp;c.…
The spinners are frequently attacked with vertigo and fainting, and
many accidents have occurred by their falling on the machinery. They
also suffer from varicose veins and œdema of the ankles.” After
describing the “mill fever” consequent on first employment, Dr.
Purdon adds: “A peculiar eruption also attacks the uncovered parts
of the body. This I call lichen. I have never seen an adult affected
with it. The cause is said to be the effect of the flax water on the
young person’s skin.” He recommends that no half-timers be employed
in the unhealthy processes, and that those who are so employed
should be at least fifteen years of age, healthy, and well developed; a
thorough system of ventilation should be carried out in these rooms; the
wearing of the Baker respirator made compulsory; a quarterly inspection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
of the mill by the certifying surgeon, who should see the effect the
work has on the constitution of those engaged, and, if suffering from incipient
disease, they should be obliged to cease working; also there should
be an examination on every fresh engagement. “In order to lessen as
much as possible the number of deaths that occur among children, each
mother ought not to be allowed to resume work for at least two months
after the birth of her child, and then should be obliged, when going to
work each day, to bring her child to a public <i>crêche</i>, paying for its
support a certain sum per week. She at present pays an old woman
who farms them. The <i>crêche</i> ought to be visited weekly by the certifying
surgeon, who is to inspect each child, and if he finds any to be
suffering from want of maternal nourishment, or from disease, he is
then to send a printed notice to the employer of the mother, stating
that she is required to take care of her sick child. She is not to be
allowed to return to her work until the child ceases to require her
attention. The <i>crêche</i> to be under Government inspection.”</p>

<p>§ <b>Deaths of Belfast Mill Workers.</b>&mdash;Matters are
substantially the same to-day in Belfast as they were when
Dr. Purdon wrote. The factories were under the Act then
as they are now, and, with the exception of raising the age
of half-timers and fixing the limit of a month after confinement
as the period during which a mother may not be
legally employed&mdash;amendments which apply to every
branch of textile and non-textile industries&mdash;no changes of
any importance have been made. I am enabled to give
here the mortality returns extracted from the Belfast
register of the deaths of mill-workers during the year 1891,
and they will show in the most convincing manner the
effect of this occupation upon health.</p>

<p><b>Mortality among Women.</b>&mdash;It will be seen that of
413 women who died in the course of the year, no fewer
than 210, or more than one-half, died of phthisis, and 125
of these were under the age of 25. Again, there were 71
women who died from respiratory diseases, so that we get
a grand total of 281 deaths amongst the women from
pulmonary disorders. How closely this terrible state of
things is connected with the nature of the occupation may
be judged from the following extract from the report of the
Medical Officer of Health for Belfast for the year 1892.
Commenting on the fact that of the 6,537 deaths registered
during 1891, 1,017 were attributable to phthisis, and
1,784 to disease of the respiratory organs, Dr. Whitaker
remarks:</p>

<div class="blockquote smaller">

<p>“As is well known, a large proportion of our working class population
is employed in mills and factories, and I would point out that the
nature of their employment must cause any of them having a predisposition
to chest affections to be ready sufferers therefrom. Breathing,
as they must do, a close, heated atmosphere, laden with particles
of flax-dust, fibrous and other matters irritating to the lungs; going
from thence directly, it may be, into the cold, damp, or frosty air,
poorly and lightly clad; often too young&mdash;especially the female
workers&mdash;to bear the exposure to which they are subjected, it is
scarcely to be wondered at that the mortality from these diseases is as
great as it is. There is little doubt but that any arrangement by
which these changes of temperature could be made less frequent or
less trying would be attended with considerable benefit to the
health of the workers. Unhealthy occupations principally affect the
respiratory organs. The dust of the flax in the manufacture of our
staple industry is a serious cause of bronchitis and phthisis, and
should lead, if possible, to greater supervision in the ventilation or
filtration of the air in our large spinning mills.”</p>

</div>

<p>The sickness in the linen and cotton trade is attributable
to various causes. There is the dust which rises from the
material; the heat and watery vapour; the dust from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
Cornish clay which is used in the weaving departments for
sizing; the long standing; and the stooping position which
has to be maintained in some departments. And if we
add to these the strain on the attention throughout all the
hours of monotonous work, the great noise, and the bad
air poisoned with over-crowding and poor ventilation, we
shall agree with Dr. Arlidge that we have cause enough
here for disease. Accidents abound in these great mills,
where the machines in rapid motion are placed so closely
together that the workers are constantly in danger from
loose gearing, and flying shuttles from the looms in motion
often cause the loss of an eye and sometimes even of life.</p>

<p><b>Shoddy, Silk, and Lace.</b>&mdash;The manufacture of shoddy
is attended by the production of an amount of dust that is
injurious to the operatives’ health, and the effluvium given
off from the rags is another excessively trying feature of
this trade. Those who are engaged in it almost invariably
have to pass through the ordeal of what is known as
“shoddy fever,” a disagreeable though not dangerous
illness, the symptoms of which usually last for at least a
week, and disappear as the worker grows accustomed to
the presence of the dust. Silk weaving is on the whole
the healthiest of the textile trades, though here we find a
process, which is resorted to also in some departments of
the cotton trade and largely in lace-making, which is most
prejudicial to health; it is known as “gassing.” This
process consists in passing the threads very rapidly through
gas jets, the object being to burn away any slight irregularities.
Medical evidence shews strongly the evils which
befall the operatives who have to spend their time in an
atmosphere highly charged with the products of gas combustion,
full of fluff and exceedingly hot. The operatives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
in the lace trade, which is carried on mostly at Nottingham,
suffer in an especial degree from “gassing.” There is not
sufficient space at my disposal to go into the numerous
family of trades in which the worker is liable to suffer
from dust given off; but amongst them are carpet-making,
hair-dressing, the flock trade, and those departments of the
upholstery trade in which fluffy material is used. Unfortunately
the drawback noticed by Dr. Arlidge of the lack
of precise medical evidence in the cotton trade exists also
in these industries.</p>

<p><b>The Potteries.</b>&mdash;So far we have been considering
dust of vegetable origin; but this forms only one group,
although it is with this group especially that women are
concerned. In the pottery trade, however, the workers are
exposed to mineral dust, and in this trade women are very
largely engaged. Experts differ somewhat in their view of
the relative injury caused by organic and inorganic dusts,
though it seems to be agreed that where the material
is chiefly of a gelatinous character the harm done is
comparatively trivial. But we need not examine closely
into these matters, for the statistics of death and disease
furnished by the Pottery District are conclusive as to the
injuries inflicted. To a lesser degree women are employed
in the subsidiary branches of the Sheffield trades, but in
this case it is the men who bear the full brunt of the
injury. Men and women work in the pottery trade, and
the dust given off is of such a fine character that it
finds its way into every corner of the factory. Thus
women who may not be immediately employed in the
finishing processes which are attended to by men, may
still receive their share of the fine white penetrating
powder. But in certain parts of the work, and those the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
most dangerous, women only are employed. Such are the
china-scourers and the towers. It is the towers’ business
to put a smooth surface on the dry ware, which is set in
rapid rotation whilst sand paper or some other medium
of the kind is applied. The result is that in the course
of the day the workers get powdered all over with the
dust that is given off, besides inhaling a considerable quantity.
Where no fans are at work to draw off this dust the
consequences are terribly destructive, and the tower, unless
she happens to be a person of exceptionally fine constitution,
succumbs in the course of a few years, sometimes
of a few months, to the accumulation of fine particles in
the pulmonary passages. Even where a fan is at work the
presence of the white powder may be detected on the
person of the worker, and as the dust is constantly blown
by her from the ware, some portion of it is inevitably
inhaled by the act of inspiration. Dr. Greenhow, who was
sent by Sir John Simon, the medical officer of health for
the Privy Council in 1861, to report on the potters’ diseases,
wrote as follows about the china scourers, and the conditions
to-day are precisely the same as they were then:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote smaller">

<p>“China scourers remove loose flint powder from the baked china, and
in doing so, partly by brushing, partly by rubbing with sand paper,
they send much flint dust into the atmosphere about them&mdash;a dust
which is lighter and floats more obstinately in the air in proportion as
the earthenware is fine. This dust inhaled into the lungs of the workpeople
is a terrible irritant to the bronchial surface which it invades.
The women (for the occupation is a female one) soon get habitual
shortness of breath, with cough and expectoration; very often they
have bleeding from the lungs, sometimes also from the nose, and their
chronic disease is from time to time accelerated by more acute catarrhal
attacks to which they are particularly subject. Comparatively few
china scourers continue long at the employment; those who continue
at it become sooner or later asthmatical, those who relinquish it in
time are said occasionally to regain perfect health, but for the greater
number the mischief is reported to be irretrievable. Against the
danger of this occupation scarcely any provision has been made. A
scourer who had worked eight years, and was suffering from chronic
bronchitis, said that four other scourers who were employed in the
same room had died from the effect of the occupation since she had
commenced it, and that a fifth was then at the point of death. In a
third pottery, a woman who had worked ten years at the occupation
asserted that about twelve other scourers in the same shop had died
since she entered it. Out of thirteen china scourers belonging to six
or seven different potteries, whose evidence was taken, only four were
in good health; nine were suffering in consequence of their occupation.”</p>

</div>

<p>The evils caused by the dust are aggravated by the very
close and stuffy atmosphere in which much of the work is
carried on.</p>

<p><b>White Lead.</b>&mdash;We come now to consider some of
the effects caused by working poisonous materials. Foremost
among these come the trades into which lead enters.
By some strange and perverse fate the manufacture of
this deadly commodity is, so far as this country is concerned,
undertaken largely by women. This is due in a
great part to the fact that their labour can be procured
more cheaply than that of men, and that the operations in
which they are engaged require but little skill or training.
In the white lead works of Newcastle, Sheffield, and East
London the women are employed in carrying heavy weights
on their heads, climbing ladders while loaded in the same
way, and in fact in performing those operations which are
usually done by means of trucks and hoists and other
mechanical appliances. Anyone who has watched the
white-lead women passing backwards and forwards in their
long, weary trampings under their heavy loads, clambering
up and down the ladders, or passing the lead from hand to
hand up a staging beside the stoves where it has to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
heated, must realise how thoroughly retrograde in its
tendency, as well as mischievous in its physical and moral
effects, is the existence of a class of cheap and unresisting
labour which the manufacturer can bend into any shape,
or turn to any purpose that he chooses. The most ardent
advocates of perfect freedom for women in matters industrial
will scarcely defend the system of transport, and
transport of a highly poisonous material, which depends
upon the cheap supply of women’s heads, or the system
of elevators which is kept up in the same fashion.</p>

<p>But the physically exacting and degrading conditions
of the work, though unmatched in this and probably any
other European country, are as nothing compared with the
action of the lead poison upon the health of the women.
No woman working in the dangerous processes of a white
lead mill can escape attack, for the subtle poison permeates
the system, resulting in the slighter cases in faintness,
sickness, and weakness; in the graver instances in lead
colic, epilepsy, paralysis, blindness, madness, or death.
After all the precautions that have been adopted so far
under the Factory Act, it has been demonstrated too clearly
that the lead poison retains the upper hand and finds its
way into the system in the form of dust, which is either
swallowed, absorbed through the pores of the skin, or
works in under the finger and toe nails in defiance of baths
and nail brushes and the swallowing of sulphuric acid
drinks. In spite of the establishment of a sort of hygienic
police, which is maintained in the best works with a view
to enforcing regularity in the matter of baths, lead poisoning
remains to-day a common feature in white lead works.
During five years 145 cases have been treated in the
Newcastle Infirmary, in addition to many others at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
Newcastle Union and Gateshead Union, and whilst in
Poplar Workhouse 30 cases were treated in 1882, there
were 28 cases in 1892. From Newcastle comes the report
that the greatest human wrecks which pass under the
notice of the medical charities are workers from the lead
mills, and when we examine the following biographies of
lead workers we shall hardly marvel at Dr. Oliver’s emphatic
view as to the pernicious character of this trade for women.</p>

<p><b>Injurious Effects of White Lead.</b>&mdash;Barbara R&mdash;&mdash;,
a married woman, aged thirty-three years, was admitted
to the infirmary on December 4th, 1890, and died the
following day from lead poisoning. She had never worked
in the lead more than a few days at a time. Eliza H&mdash;&mdash;,
aged twenty-five, after five months working in the
“stacks” was seized with colic and was ill for seven weeks.
On recovery she worked for two years in the stoves, and
then had another attack of colic. On getting better she was
seized with a fit on her way to work at six o’clock in
the morning, and was unconscious for fifteen minutes. Her
comrades then helped her into the factory, where she
worked all day, feeling very shaky. During the two
months that followed she was better, but at the end of
that time was seized with convulsions while at work. She
became unconscious, and was taken to the workhouse
hospital, where she had a succession of fits, followed by
total blindness, and death was narrowly escaped.</p>

<p><b>Effect on Offspring.</b>&mdash;Although the law prescribes
eighteen years as the minimum age at which women may
follow this occupation, two cases have occurred recently
in which girls have died from lead poisoning who were
under the age. Nor does the suffering cease with the men
and women who work in the lead mills; they bequeath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
an awful legacy of sickness to their children&mdash;an amount
of suffering which is almost disproportionate to their own.
I came not long ago in contact with a woman who had
worked for the fifteen years of her married life on the
“pans” in a lead mill, a process which is considered to be
non-dangerous; during her employment she had suffered
little, yet this woman had never borne a living child. I
give another dismal chronicle in support of my remarks.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
“C. E., twenty-seven years of age. There was first a living
child, then one miscarriage. She left the lead works and
went into the country, where a second child was born. She
then returned to the lead works and had two miscarriages.
M. W., aged thirty-nine, a lead worker for eighteen
years, has had twelve children, of whom four are now
living. The remaining eight died at ages varying from five
days to four, six, and fourteen months, in convulsions. She
has had in addition five miscarriages, three in succession.
In the case of Mary A&mdash;&mdash;, aged forty years, whose mother
too had been a lead worker, we have a history of eight
children, all of whom died in convulsions.” In one form or
another paralysis too is common among the workers. It is
sometimes acute and sometimes chronic, and its
commonest manifestation is in “wrist-drop,”&mdash;loss of power
in the wrist. The victim of “wrist-drop” is incapacitated
from lifting or moving anything or in any way using
the hands, and this crippled condition sometimes lasts
for life.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Greater Susceptibility of Women.</b>&mdash;The greatest
authorities on the subject of lead-poisoning, notably Dr.
Oliver, lay stress on the greater liability to lead-poisoning
which women show over men. Not only do we find that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
women are more susceptible, but they are susceptible
earlier in life. Girls from 18 to 23 years of age are at
the most susceptible age, while with men the dangers of
lead-poisoning are greatest between 41 and 48. The
fashion in which men and women suffer differs also, for we
note that, while young women suffer very readily from
“saturnian poison”&mdash;fall quickly victims to colic, and
recover to be again and more severely attacked&mdash;men
may work for long terms of years, suffering slightly and
seldom, till they fall victims, at the end of long service,
to paralysis. It must be borne in mind, however, that
those women who have been the subject of Dr. Oliver’s
investigation have been brought more directly and constantly
into contact with the peculiarly dangerous processes
of lead manufacture than the men.</p>

<p><b>White Lead in other Manufactures.</b>&mdash;But the
actual manufacture of white lead is only one and the first of
the stages in this commodity’s devastating course. We may
trace its steps in the potteries, where men and women in
large numbers fall victims to the lead which is used in the
glazes; in the black country, where we find it applied to
the tin-sheet enamelling trade, which is now covering the
railway stations and other places with advertisements; and
in the colour trade and many other industries, to say
nothing of that of painters and decorators. Nearly 100
cases of lead-poisoning were treated in the Wolverhampton
Infirmary in 1892, the majority of which consisted of
young girls who were employed in the sheet-iron enamelling
trade, and there have been several cases of deaths in this
industry of recent years.</p>

<p><b>Lucifer Match Trade.</b>&mdash;Necrosis of the jaw is a
disease of a peculiarly horrible character, to be found in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
the match-making trade. It is due to the use of
phosphorus, and first attacks the jaw-bone, working its
way through the teeth and gums. Owing, however, to the
adoption of greater precautions and the substitution of
other materials for “white” phosphorus necrosis now counts
fewer victims than formerly.</p>

<p><b>Ventilation.</b>&mdash;But great as are the evils of trade
diseases, these are not general, and exist only in particular
trades; whereas when we turn to the question
of factory ventilation and heating, and the worker’s
general environment, we find that in all directions health
is being undermined, and in nearly every occupation there
is something wrong. One of the worst evils of factory
and workshop arrangements is the absence of proper
ventilation, and the consequent lack of a supply of pure
air. We may be met by the reply that the opposition of
the <i>employés</i> is to a large extent responsible for the discomforts
under which they work, and that it is impossible
to ventilate rooms properly while the workpeople fill the
ventilators with rags as soon as the manager’s back is
turned. Such stories as these belong to the same class of
anecdotes as those which detail the objection of the worker
to wearing some species of gag for keeping out dust, or to
the incessant repetition of the act of washing the hands or
brushing the hair for the removal of injurious particles, and
they do not really affect the general question. The fact is,
that we are all creatures of habit more or less, and if we
are accustomed to working under certain conditions the
majority of us would be something more than human
if ready to preserve a high hygienic standard in face of
constant daily exposure to prejudicial surroundings. The
sensible policy, therefore, is surely not to neglect practicable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
remedies because of cases of individual carelessness, but
to recognise at once that the only effectual course is to
make the conditions on which the worker is so largely
dependent as healthy as possible. Besides, after all
points of view have been considered, there is a good
deal to be said for workers’ objections. Clumsy attempts
at ventilation are largely responsible for the dislike to
fresh air which is to be found in many workshops; just
as ill-made respirators, which only succeed in checking
free breathing without excluding the dust or whatever
it may be that is to be kept out, may have induced
a certain recklessness of precautions on the part of the
operatives in certain trades. But however that may be,
until we come to recognise that the hygienic condition
of the factory and workshop is a matter for the scientist
and the community in precisely the same way that the
hygienic condition of the town is, it will be hopeless to
expect the maintenance or even the recognition of any
industrial standard of health. Employers are as much
creatures of circumstances as their workpeople, and it
would be fatuous to the last degree to hope for very
much from the “moralisation of workshop environment.”
If there is to be any effective safeguard it must be found in
the regulations prescribed by the community as a whole, to
which the enfeebling and crippling of its workers represents
a very real danger.</p>

</div>

<p><b>The Registrar-General’s Returns.</b>&mdash;It is obvious
that the influence of occupation upon the health of married
women cannot be adequately considered without some
inquiry as to its effects upon the life and health of their
children. As is the case with so many other vitally
important branches of industrial life, there is but scanty
information of a statistical kind here to guide us, though
there is enough local information, taken in conjunction
with the general statistics which are published from time to
time by the Registrar-General, to establish a close relation
between the employment of married women and a high
infantile rate of mortality. In his annual report, the
Registrar-General goes into the subject in some detail.
He begins by pointing out that the year 1891 showed that
the proportion of deaths of infants under one year to a
thousand registered births was 149 per thousand, a proportion
which was equalled in 1886, and slightly exceeded
in 1890, but was otherwise higher than in any year of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
the preceding decennium. He remarks upon the wide
differences to be found between the rates in the various
counties, and the persistence of these differences from
year to year; “the general rule being that the rate is
lowest in the purely agricultural, and highest in the mining
counties and those of the textile industries. It is in the
towns of these latter counties that the infantile mortality
assumes the highest proportion; the three towns which
are invariably, or almost invariably, the worst in this
respect being Preston, Leicester, and Blackburn.”</p>

<p>This is highly significant, and but for the fact that
statistics have been successful in isolating several towns
associated with certain industries in which married women
are very largely employed, it might have been urged that
the high rate of mortality in the towns was simply due
to density of population, lack of fresh air, space, and
sunlight. But the Registrar-General, by the tables which
he has compiled in his last report, enables us to judge
as to the effect upon child life, first, of country air
and conditions; secondly, of the average urban conditions;
and thirdly, of urban conditions plus the employment
of women in factory labour. Seeing that Preston,
Leicester, and Blackburn had the highest infantile death-rates
of all the towns included in the weekly returns
from 1881 to 1891, he has selected them for what we
will call Group III. Then he has taken five mining or
industrial counties, namely, Staffordshire, Leicestershire,
Lancashire, West Riding, and Durham; and three
agricultural counties, namely, Hertfordshire, Wiltshire,
and Dorsetshire. With the help of the death registers
of the various counties and towns for the years 1889,
1890, and 1891, tables have been prepared showing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
causes of death and the exact ages of infants under a
year old who had died, out of one hundred thousand born
in each of the various districts.</p>

</table>

<p><b>Age-periods and Mortality.</b>&mdash;The table shews at a
glance that there are more than double as many deaths in
the selected towns as in the rural counties&mdash;22,000 as
against 10,000, whilst the manufacturing counties stand at
17,000. It must, however, be observed that this last group
contains the textile districts and various other typically unhealthy
trade areas, so that it is scarcely a fair criterion. An
examination of more detailed statistics which have been
reduced to a tabular shape shew, as the Registrar-General
points out, that in the rural counties and the three selected
towns the mortality is at its maximum in the first week,
falls heavily in the second week, remains at much the same
level during the third week, and then shews a fresh very
considerable decline in the fourth. To summarise his
conclusions as to the points of likeness between counties
and towns:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span> “Both shew an excessively high mortality in
the earliest days of life, which becomes less and less as
days, weeks, and months pass by, until the seventh or
eighth month has elapsed, when the decline either is
arrested or becomes very much smaller. In both the
mortality is so high in the first three days, or even in the
entire first week, that, were it maintained without diminution,
every infant would die without nearly completing one
year of its existence.” But now coming to the points of
difference. We have seen in the first place that the town
rate is more than twice as high as the country. But the
town rate is not merely higher for the whole period, but
higher for each fraction of the year. Moreover, the town
rates are most in excess of the country ones, not in the
earliest weeks or months of infancy, but in the later
months. “In the first week of life, the town rate exceeds
the rural rate by 23 per cent., in the second week by 64
per cent., in the third week by 83 per cent., and in the
fourth week by 97 per cent. The same result comes out
when the rates for successive months in the counties and
towns are examined. In the first month the town mortality
is 27 per cent. above the rural rate, in the second month
121 above it, and the excess then goes on increasing until
in the sixth month it amounts to no less than 273 per cent.
This is the month in which the difference is greatest,
though it remains throughout the rest of the year at a
not very much lower point.” This progressive increase is
a most significant fact, and it is much to be wished that
instead of concluding his examination at the limit of one
year of age, the Registrar had continued it, say up to five
years, so that he might have been able to form some notion
of the further loss of life which falls upon the children in
the districts where their mothers are employed in the mills
and factories. There is not space here to reproduce the
two tables in which the Registrar-General enumerates the
causes of death in the rural and town districts, together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
with the ages at which death takes place. But these tables
are of such extreme importance that it may be well to
compare some of the more general causes of death.</p>

<p><b>Relation of Married Women’s labour to Infant
Mortality. Dr. Tatham’s Evidence.</b>&mdash;The most
striking difference between the rural districts and the selected
towns is in the case of diarrhœa, which, taken with enteritis,
shews a mortality seven times as great in towns as in the
country. These figures tell their own tale, but it may be
well to add the testimony of Dr. Tatham, for many years the
medical officer for Manchester and Salford, as given before
the labour Commission. “In the year 1881 my attention
was first seriously directed to the employment of young
mothers in factories, in the course of my investigations concerning
the causes of our abnormally heavy infant mortality,
Salford being one of the great English towns in which infant
mortality was year after year notoriously excessive. As a
result of anxious inquiry, extending over many years, I was,
and still am, convinced that very much of that excessive
mortality was due to infant neglect, consequent on the withdrawal
of maternal care within a few weeks of the birth of
the children. In consequence of this practice the infants
were frequently consigned to the care of some ignorant
neighbour, or were nursed at home by an older child of the
family. The children were artificially and often improperly
fed, and a heavy death-roll was the ultimate result.”</p>

<p>Questioned by the Chairman as to the time, in his
opinion, a mother should remain at home after the birth of
the child, Dr. Tatham said, “I should not be consistent if
I said less than six months.”</p>

<p>“That of course in your opinion would have a very
important influence upon the rate of mortality?” “I think
it would.”</p>

<p>“And upon the nurture of the children?” “I think so.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>
<p>“Is it within your experience that a considerable number
of young married women work in factories?” “A very
large number.”</p>

<p>“You speak of the effect upon infant mortality; could
you say anything of the effect upon the mothers themselves?”
“I have no doubt that the health of the mothers will be
damaged. It must be so, I am sure; that part of the
subject has not engaged my attention so much as this
terrible question of infant mortality.”</p>

<p>It may also be interesting to add the one question which
was asked by the representative of the manufacturing
interest, Mr. Tunstill, a cotton spinner&mdash;“Have you considered
the financial question that is involved in this
recommendation of yours?” And the answer, “I have
purposely avoided that; I leave that to those much better
able to judge of it than I am.”</p>

<p><b>Dr. Farr’s Tables.</b>&mdash;It is most unfortunate that
there should be such a lack of medical and statistical evidence
as to the effect of factory labour upon the health of
mothers. For this, I suppose, we shall have to wait for the
gradual development of the human element in statistical
science, though local medical evidence can be produced to
shew the mischief that is constantly caused to the mother’s
health. This question of infant mortality is at any rate
beyond the region of the speculative, and all schools of
thought, however divided they may be by the great controversy
between freedom and the regulation of women’s
labour, must be agreed that it would be nothing short of a
national disgrace to allow matters to drift on year after year
as they have been doing for many years past. It is now
twenty years since Dr. Farr, the great health statistician,
shewed the waste of life that was going on in the textile
centres. He took the towns of Oldham, Nottingham, Manchester,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
Salford, Leeds, Norwich, Portsmouth, and London,
found the number of women of twenty years and upwards
who were engaged in the textile manufactures and household
duties in each, and then worked out the particulars of infant
mortality from 1873 to 1875. The result, which is to be
found in a table in his work on <i>Vital Statistics</i>, is extremely
striking. Thus, in Oldham, where 11,178 women were set
down as engaged in textile manufacture, out of a total of
32,343 women of twenty years of age and upwards, the infant
death rate per thousand births stood at 180; in Nottingham,
where upwards of half the women were similarly employed,
at 200; in Manchester and Salford, where a quarter of the
women were engaged in textile manufacture, at 188; in
Portsmouth, where there is no textile work, 146; and in
London, where there is also none, 159.</p>

<p><b>Recent Statistics.</b>&mdash;But in 1891 the infantile death
rate in the worst textile towns exceeded any of the figures
produced by Dr. Farr. Thus in Preston the mortality
was 220. There is a slight improvement, but only slight,
in the other towns investigated by Dr. Farr. Thus in
Oldham the rate is 171 instead of 180, in Manchester
178 instead of 188. None of the figures that have
been published, however, give anything like an adequate
account of the real state of affairs. What we want is a
statement confined to the children of those employed in
any given industry where married women’s labour is
prevalent. To take an entire town like Manchester or
Salford is only to approximate to the facts. In both these
towns there are healthy suburbs and large numbers of
well-to-do people whose children are taken away every
year to the seaside, and there are many industries which
are healthy, and where no women’s labour is employed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
But anyone who cares to take the trouble to examine the
Registrar’s report, and to work out the death rates of the
poorer quarters of Manchester and Salford, Bradford,
Burnley, and Blackburn, or to take the Potteries and make
similar calculations for Hanley, Burslem, and Stoke will
be appalled by the contrast between the figures of those
places and the rural death rate. He will find that,
instead of being twice as high, the rate of infant mortality is
even four or five times as high as in the country districts.
Such figures as we have however, are sufficient, as I
have said, to shew the close connection between the
employment of mothers in mills and the death of
children.</p>

<p><b>Deterioration of Survivors.</b>&mdash;As to the deterioration
of the survivors there can be no question. The
evidence of Dr. Tarrop, quoted before, and of other
certifying surgeons is conclusive on this point. That
school of thought which frames its industrial policy on the
theory of the survival of the fittest, can scarcely point
to any very triumphant results in the districts which we
have been considering. They may assert, and will no
doubt continue to assert, that the wholesale sweeping-off
of damaged lives in the early months is a great boon to
the race, and that the survivors, having stood the ordeal,
are presumably more or less seasoned for the discharge
of their functions. It must be pointed out, however,
that the tests applied are one and all unnatural ones,
and that if the laws of nature are to be consulted we shall
be right in assuming that the children who have died
are those who were best fitted to live. For what are we
to think of the standard of living which subjects all
new-comers to their capacity of assimilating adulterated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
and unhealthy food, dispensing with maternal care,
breathing air which is foul, and existing without sunshine?
Yet this is the kind of test which the pseudo-scientists
of the day are so proud of applying, and the
result is a weedy, sickly, unnatural generation, brought
up without regard to any one of the most fundamental
laws of nature. It would be every bit as reasonable to
evolve a system of botany which rejected, as extinct or
dying, families of plants, which could not be cultivated
in a dark chamber or in a refrigerator, as to create
conditions of industrial life without reference to the laws
of nature or the teachings of health, and then to argue
that the fitness of the race depends upon compliance
with them.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Factory Legislation Incomplete.</b>&mdash;There is an
idea abroad, which is quite unwarranted, that our body
of factory legislation is more or less final in its character,
and that it has, in fact, accomplished the purpose for
which it was intended by its authors. The provisions of
the Factory Acts range themselves for the most part under
three heads. They deal either with educational matters,
with the regulation of the hours of labour, or with sanitary
conditions. It needs no argument to show that great
progress in public opinion has been taking place in respect
of these three points. The Public Health Act is
sufficient evidence of the progressing standard of health
in surroundings and conditions; the Education Act is
certainly not of a final kind, and on no question<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
has public feeling developed more rapidly of recent years
than on that of the adaptation of the hours of labour
to human capacity and health. If, on the one hand, the
standard by which we are to test the effectiveness of such
legislative provisions as come under these heads is much
higher than it was a few years luck; on the other hand, it
must be remembered that industrial conditions are not a
hard and fixed quantity, that they vary with the progress of
invention, the incidence of competition, the creation or
alteration of tariff frontiers, and many other causes.
The knowledge of chemical methods alone has introduced
revolutionary changes into many industries, so that
regulations which were drawn up ten years ago to meet
a given state of things may be out of place or inoperative
now. The Factory Acts, for instance, were designed in
large part to protect women and children from the
exhausting effects of prolonged toil, the idea at the root
of the measures being the same great principle which
underlies our whole system of public health. But when
the agitation for the ten hours’ day culminated in the
Factory Act the question, after all, was not settled. It
was within the bounds of possibility that such mechanical
contrivances could be devised as to make the period of
legalised toil quite as harmful to the operatives, or, indeed,
more so, than the longer day. The question whether
intense toil concentrated into a relatively short period, is
more or less trying to the human frame than if the same
toil were dispersed over a relatively longer period, cannot
be settled off-hand. But the fact undoubtedly remains, as
I have shewn in the chapter on textile industries, that
machinery has been speeded up to a point which is
immensely in excess of that which prevailed when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
hours were longer. At the present time, therefore, the
strain upon the attention and the wear and tear of the
nervous system are greatly in excess of former times, and
the worker must be “on the stretch” the whole time to
attend properly to the work. The illustration will serve
to show how the factors governing the industrial situation
shift from time to time, and act and react on one
another, and that if factory legislation and administration
are to be really effective they must keep pace with the
times and adapt themselves to changing conditions.</p>

<p>The fact that so large a number of additions and
modifications have been made in our factory legislation
since 1802, when the first intervention of the State on
behalf of factory children took place, shews that some
attempt at least has been made to grapple with this
part of the question. It may suffice for our immediate
purpose to note the clear intention and spirit of British
factory legislation; viz., the protection of those who are
unable to help themselves in the matter of securing humane
conditions of labour. Thus, the State does not allow
children to work all their time in a factory until they are
thirteen years of age, and not then unless they have
attained to a standard of school proficiency, which is fixed
by the Secretary of State; nor does it allow half-timers to
begin work until they are eleven. Then again, no child
or young person of either sex under sixteen years of age is
allowed to enter a factory without obtaining a certificate from
the certifying surgeon as to his or her fitness for the work.
If a fatal accident happens in a workshop, or a serious or fatal
accident in a factory, the certifying surgeon has to give in
his report on the case. Then again, night-work is absolutely
forbidden for women and children. But the State contemplates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
much more than this. It provides that workmen as
well as women and children shall secure conditions such as
are not prejudicial to their health and well-being. There
are clauses in the Factory Acts&mdash;permissive, it is true, for
the most part&mdash;bearing upon the efficient ventilation of
factories and workshops, and providing for the installation
of fans in certain cases; for the purifying of the atmosphere
where noxious, poisonous, or offensive matter or injurious
dusts are given off in the process of work; and for a certain
allowance of space and air. Anyone who goes through the
Acts carefully can have no doubt that the protection originally
accorded to women and children has now in certain important
respects been recognised by the State as a claim to
be enforced on behalf of every class of workmen. Nor must
we forget, in estimating the functions of the State in relation
to labour, that the Factory Acts form one of an entire class
of legislation which is based on the principle that human
life and health are the direct care of the organised community,
and can under no circumstances become, whether
by hire or sale or any other form of contract, the property
of the employing class. Thus the Mines Regulation Act
forbids the employment of women underground, and fixes
the age of twelve as that in which boys may go below
ground; whilst it formulates a complete and most elaborate
code of precautionary measures in the interests of the
workmen. The Employers’ Liability Act belongs to the
same category, for it throws upon the employer in a large
number of cases the responsibility for injury done to his
workpeople in the course of their employment.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> It is clear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
then that the State is committed to a principle the maintenance
of which involves responsibilities of the profoundest
importance, and for the carrying out of which in their
entirety not only vigilance and a highly organised staff of
trained inspectors are necessary, but close and scientific
acquaintance with various forms of industry, and with the
physiological effects of these various forms upon life and
health&mdash;in a word, administrative experience of an extremely
high order. And this brings us to an inquiry as to the
administrative efficiency as well as the legislative symmetry
of these great industrial measures.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_18" id="Footnote_18"></a><a href="#FNanchor_18"><span class="label">[18]</span></a> The Bill recently rejected by the House of Lords contained a
clause enabling workpeople to claim compensation from employers
who had omitted to take reasonable precautions for securing healthy
conditions, in the event of such neglect injuring their health.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Reasons for Inefficiency.</b>&mdash;But notwithstanding
such admirable intentions on the part of the State
many abuses still thrive amongst women workers, excessive
hours are frequently worked, and hundreds and
thousands of women break down every year or become
prematurely old from overwork, or from the very unhealthy
conditions which the Factory Acts are designed
to put an end to. In spite of certifying surgeons and
the code of public health enjoined by the Acts the children
who enter our factories turn out totally unfitted for the
strain, and grow up into half-developed beings or fall victims
to some form of industrial disease. To some the criticism
may suggest itself that these things cannot be cured
by Act of Parliament or by encroaching on the liberty of
the individual. However, as modern States have agreed
that the protection of human life is one of the first reasons
of their existence, and as common-sense, to say nothing of
humanity, does not see much to regret in the limitation of
the liberty of one class to inflict grave hardships upon
another, such an objection will not take us much further.
Moreover, there is a sufficient explanation of the comparative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
breakdown of good intentions without laying the
blame upon Acts of Parliament. The gap between intention
and performance, which is presumably to be found
in most of our institutions as well as in individuals, is in
truth not lacking in our protective labour regulations, and
the vaguer the intention the greater the gap. And it would
not be fair to lay the blame for the failure in giving substance
to the Acts altogether upon those who administer them.</p>

<p><b>Factory Acts a Compromise.</b>&mdash;The Factory Acts
are of the nature of a compromise between two different
social schools. The vague phraseology, the lack of a
definite standard, the readiness to grant exceptions to
certain trades, and, under certain conditions, the large discretion
left in the hands both of the Secretary of State and
the Inspectors of Factories, these are amongst the signs of
the contending elements among which the Acts represent
a compromise. Where, as in the case of the textile trades,
a definite working day is laid down and overtime is absolutely
prohibited, the administration of the Acts is a comparatively
simple matter. The factory inspector and the
factory clock between them are a match for the employer
who is disposed to let his machinery run beyond the legal
limit. On the other hand, where the emphatic “shall”
which applies to the textile trades is changed into “may,”
where overtime is permitted on account of a press of
orders, or of season requirements, or the perishable nature
of certain commodities, the standard of administration must
inevitably become relaxed like the Acts themselves. Several
instances, somewhat too technical perhaps to be given
here, might be produced in which the Acts have been so
drafted as to place the staff of inspectors in an almost
impossible position. Thus they are supposed in a general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
way to see that factories and workshops are properly
ventilated, and that conditions of health are favourable.
When overtime is worked each person is supposed to have
an allowance of 400 cubic feet of space, and the inspector
is expected to be the judge of what is healthy or injurious
in various processes of manufacture. These surely are
cases in which a feeble and uninformed intention, rather
than defective executive measures, must be held responsible
for lack of results. It is obviously unreasonable to throw
the responsibility upon an inspector of introducing a variety
of highly-technical hygienic appliances into buildings which
have been designed and erected without regard to health,
and in which plant and machinery have been laid down
with a single eye to production&mdash;just as unreasonable in
fact as to try to preserve a town from typhoid fever by
taking precautions after a defective drainage system has
been completed instead of before.</p>

<p><b>Experts Required.</b>&mdash;Again, a staff of experts is
necessary for carrying out the public health side of
such an Act as this, and yet the Home Secretary, with
no experts to consult, is expected to preside as a
minister of industrial health over the welfare of the vast
mass of the working population, whilst duties are thrown
upon the inspectors which could only be efficiently discharged
with the help of expert sanitarians, engineers,
architects, chemists, and medical men. The requirement
of 400 cubic feet of space is an instance of the official brain
working in a vacuum, and here again the administrative
side is not to be blamed. How is a factory inspector to
see that every person who works overtime gets his 400 feet?
How can he calculate? Is he to set his calculation against
that of the manufacturer who is anxious to keep all his hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
working extra hours, and who assures him that, after making
due deduction for bench room, machinery, and the like,
each person will enjoy his allotted share? Assuming that
it is a physical possibility for the inspector with his
measuring apparatus to get round to every place of work
where overtime is carried on, to keep a record of all the
alterations made in the workshop and the number of
persons occupied and so forth, is it to be supposed that the
inspector will carry out what is presumably the intention of
the law, namely, that each person shall have 400 feet of air
to breathe&mdash;a very different thing from 400 feet of space,
inasmuch as furnaces and gases breathe air just as much as
human beings, whilst nearly every trade sets up conditions
which tend to pollute or deteriorate it to some extent?
Let us bear in mind that the life and health of multitudes
of people hang upon the distinction between a clear and
definite regulation which is framed to be carried out and a
vague and misty one which may represent a principle and
an intention, but cannot be reduced to practice in its
clouded shape, and we shall understand the vital importance
of a clear, straightforward, and definite regulation.</p>

<p><b>Reforms Needed.</b>&mdash;Our answer then to the question,
“How is it that, in spite of Factory Acts, things are still so
bad to-day for many of the most defenceless workers?” is,
that the State has not troubled to understand where the
shoe pinches, and that in its eagerness to concede something
to supposed trading interests it has allowed confusion and
licence to interfere with the working of those humane
enactments. I therefore propose to examine briefly the
various points which call urgently for immediate reform.</p>

<p>(1) <i>In respect of Health.</i> (<i>a</i>) <i>Periodical medical examination</i>
in trades where women and children are largely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
employed. The Certifying Surgeon&mdash;who by the way
ought to be employed directly by the State and not by the
manufacturers&mdash;at present only examines the children and
young persons before they begin work in the factory, and
has no jurisdiction over workshops except upon the special
order of the Secretary of State. His duties should be
extended to workshops, and periodical examination should
be made of the women, children, and young persons&mdash;especially
of the two latter classes&mdash;where ground exists for
supposing that the conditions of any trade are injurious to
health. A body of experience should be brought together
as to the special effects of given industries upon health with
a view to such improvements and modifications being made
in mechanical and other manufacturing processes as to
minimise injurious effects.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Definite Hygienic Regulations.</i> Each industry in
which injurious processes are carried on should be subjected
to periodical investigation by experts, working in conjunction
with the Certifying Surgeons and factory inspectors, whose
duty it should be to recommend such improvements as are
feasible with a view to the protection of health. Steps
have already been taken under Section 8 of the Factory
Act, 1891, for drawing up special rules for injurious trades,
but in view of the constant changes which take place in
manufacture, it seems highly desirable that there should be
a regular staff of experts in connection with the Home
Office, so that the Factory Department could be in touch
with such industrial changes and inventions as take place
from time to time. Another very necessary step seems to
lie in the direction of some system of licensing buildings
erected for industrial purposes, so that a proper survey by
sanitary and architectural experts may be made, and any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
necessary structural alterations carried out before the work
is begun. Just as the Education Department now lays
down definite hygienic regulations to be observed in the
construction of schools, so the Factory Department, in
connection perhaps with the local authorities, should seek
to enforce a standard of healthiness.</p>

<p>(2) <i>The Employment of Mothers.</i> As the law stands at
present, the only regulation with regard to the employment
of mothers is one which forbids their employment in
factories and workshops within a month after the birth
of a child. This was one of the recommendations made
by the Berlin Conference. In the opinion of Dr. Tatham,
for many years the medical officer of health for Manchester,
and now head of the Statistical Department in the office
of the Registrar-General, as well as of many other medical
men who have studied this question for years on the spot,
this period is far too short in regard both to the health
of the mother and the welfare of the child&mdash;two points
which it is practically impossible to separate in considering
this question.</p>

<p>Whilst it may be urged on the one hand that any further
intervention on the part of the State must proceed with
the utmost caution in view of the extent to which married
women are employed, it is impossible to regard with
anything but feelings of alarm and even of consternation
such statistics on this matter as are already available, and it
would seem in the highest degree desirable that either a
Select Committee of the House of Commons, or a Departmental
Committee representing the Home Office and the
Local Government Board, should without delay extend and
consolidate the researches which have been made, with a
view to furnishing in the most reliable manner data upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
which any further enactments may be laid down. That
there will have to be a further and considerable extension
of the period referred to, and that in certain occupations
which are shewn to be peculiarly prejudicial to the health
of women the prohibition of their labour may be held to
be necessary in the public interest, are facts which no one
acquainted with the growth of public sentiment can fail to
observe.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Regulation of Hours of Labour.</i> (<i>a</i>) <i>The Abolition of
Legalised Overtime.</i> Allusion has already been made to
the grievous defect which has gradually crept into and
tended largely to destroy the efficiency of the Factory Acts.
Evidence given before the Labour Commission, and
furnished on many occasions in the annual report of the
Chief Inspector of Factories by Her Majesty’s factory
inspectors, proves conclusively that in the first place such
overtime is injurious; in the second place, that it is often
totally unnecessary; and, in the third place, that it is
impossible to keep an effective check on the period during
which work is performed. The character of that section of
the Act which enables overtime to be worked may be
judged from the following extract:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span> “Where it is proved to
the satisfaction of a Secretary of State that in any class of
non-textile factories or workshops or parts thereof, it is
necessary by reason of the material which is the subject of
the manufacturing process or handicraft therein being liable
to be spoiled by the weather, or by reason of press of work
arising at certain recurring seasons of the year, or by reason
of the liability of the business to a sudden press of orders
arising from unforeseen events, to employ young persons
and women in manner authorised by this exception, and
that such employment will not injure the health of the
young persons and women affected thereby, he may, by
order made under part of this Act, extend this exception
to such factories or workshops, or parts thereof.” Employers
are thus permitted to work women and young persons&mdash;and
a child of thirteen bearing her school certificate ranks
as a “young person”&mdash;for forty-eight days in any twelve
months for fourteen hours a day exclusive of meal times,
in flax scutch mills, brick and tile making, parts of
rope works carried on in the open air, Turkey-red dyeing
and glue making (overtime being permissible in these
cases because of considerations of weather), letterpress
printing, bookbinding, lithographic printing, Christmas
present making, firewood cutting, almanac making, ærated
water making, and playing-card making (these trades being
licensed because “press of work arises at certain recurring
seasons of the year”), the making-up of any article
of wearing apparel and furniture hangings, artificial flower
making, fancy box making, biscuit making and job
dyeing, and the extensive class of workers who are employed
in warehouses in polishing, cleaning, wrapping,
or packing up goods. The State itself also asks to be
exempted from its own laws, and we find that, by an order
gazetted September 16, 1889, the milling, perforating, and
gumming of postage and inland revenue stamps are made
the subject of legalised overtime. But the forty-eight days
which are set as the limit in these cases are doubled in
respect to that category of trades which deals with perishable
articles, so that in processes connected with preserving
fruit or fish and the making of condensed milk, women
are actually allowed by the law to work for ninety-six days in
the course of any twelve months for fourteen hours a day.</p>

<p>The only objections that can be urged to putting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
factories in general upon the same footing as those in
the textile trades are the arguments which were adduced
against the principle of State regulation of the hours of
labour. If the textile trades can be conducted without
overtime&mdash;trades which are dominated by changes of
fashion and season just as much as any other trades&mdash;is
it not absurd on the face of it to allow printers, pork-pie
makers, and a host of other manufacturers whose
business is supposed to be affected by liability to sudden
pressure of orders and by season demands to remain
untouched by the Act? Granted that excessively long
hours are necessary for certain periods in the case of
operations that have to be conducted out of doors, or
such operations as fish curing and the like, the way to
meet the difficulty is not by over-taxing the strength of
those employed, but by working double or, if necessary,
treble shifts. It cannot be too strongly urged that these
exceptions are entirely contrary to the spirit of factory
legislation, which is based upon the doctrine that trade
must adapt itself to what is necessary for the workers
in regard to their health and requirements as human
beings, and that it is entirely opposed to the theory
that human beings must adapt their standard of health
and leisure to the conveniences and exigencies of trade.
Whether the maximum hours of labour fixed for the textile
trades, <i>viz.</i>, fifty-six per week, are not too many is another
question. In the opinion of the operatives themselves
forty-eight hours are long enough, and the textile trades are
promoting a bill to give legislative force to their belief.
It has been shewn in previous chapters that the intensity of
work has greatly increased, and that the demands made
upon the strength and endurance of the workers are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
probably more severe than was the case before the passing
of the Acts. It must not be forgotten that a law
which has been made by the national legislature in such a
matter as this imposes a responsibility of the very gravest
kind upon the nation. In other trades the hours of
labour are now, generally speaking, shorter than those in
the textile trades. London builders, taking the year
round, do not work more than an average of forty-eight
hours a week, engineers work fifty-two and a half, and
so do boiler-makers and iron-founders. This is not the
place for a detailed treatment of the demand for a shorter
day, but the fact cannot be overlooked&mdash;a fact which
was insisted upon in the fifth chapter&mdash;that as motive
power and machinery replace manual work so the claim for
longer periods of rest and leisure grows stronger. There is
a danger lest society in its intense pre-occupation with the
multiplication of commodities should take up a false position
simply by forgetting this fact. But if the arguments in
favour of a general reduction of the hours of labour are strong
anywhere, they are peculiarly strong in the case of women,
for in a vast number of cases a woman, when she leaves her
daily work, has to begin a second spell of work at home.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Continuation of Work at Home after Factory Hours.</i>&mdash;This
is a practice which is openly encouraged by some
manufacturers, and more or less secretly by others. It is
a common sight, for instance, in Belfast, to see women
returning home from the handkerchief or other works in
which they have been employed during the whole day,
with bundles of work to make up at night, so that the
worker has to stitch often till midnight, or later, in order
to take the finished bundle back the next morning. In
London, too, this practice obtains. Obviously, if such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
an infringement of the spirit of the Act is allowed, the
factory regulation becomes worthless in respect of hours.</p>

<p>(4) <i>The Regulation of Outwork.</i>&mdash;By a clause in the
Act of 1891 the Home Secretary was empowered to
schedule certain trades in which work was given out by
a middleman or manufacturer&mdash;either to contractors or
to workpeople direct&mdash;to be done off the premises; to
enforce the keeping of a register giving the names and
addresses of such persons, so as to enable the factory
inspector or the sanitary authority to investigate the conditions
under which the work was being done. The
Home Secretary has made an order which brings the
clothing trades, the cabinet trade, and the electro-plating
industry under this provision, and energetic steps
have been taken to trace the work thus given out.
Obviously, however, such a task involves a large staff of
inspectors; and in cases where the duty devolves upon
the sanitary authority the expense suddenly thrown upon
the ratepayers to provide an adequate staff, added to
other considerations, has led to practically nothing being
done, so that the order remains inoperative. It is unquestionably
desirable that the person who gives out the
work should be made responsible for the sanitary and other
conditions under which it is performed, a provision which
would act as a deterrent to a practice which is admittedly
full of hardships for the workers and of risks for the consumers.
As to the latter consideration, the whole question
of the administration of the workshops part of the Factory
Acts by the local authorities will have to be revised. As
things are at present, there is no power of compelling them
to do the work, whilst the division of authority which exists
between the Factory Department and the local sanitary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
authority is very far from tending to the efficient carrying
out of the measures laid down. The great thing is, however,
that the principle of throwing the responsibility for
the conditions of labour upon the person who practically
employs such labour&mdash;whether by means of the sweating
system or not&mdash;should be recognised, and a first step in
this direction has undoubtedly been taken by the registration
order referred to.</p>

<p>(5) <i>Child Labour.</i>&mdash;Both the educational and physiological
experts who have given attention to this question are
agreed that two things should be done. The system of half-time,
under which a child spends half the week in the
factory and half in the school, is a double evil to the half-timer,
as both education and health suffer from the process.
In the opinion of many competent observers the system of
half-time should be abolished. So long, however, as it
is permitted to continue, the age of eleven which was fixed
under the new Act is undoubtedly too low, taking the
general level of European nations as a standard, for, after
all, the work in school is to the average child as hard
as work in the factory, and it is too much to demand
of young children the double strain entailed by mental,
nervous, and physical causes which is involved in the
school and factory <i>régime</i>. The age of thirteen, at which
the child passes into the “young person” stage&mdash;to use
the legal expression&mdash;and obtains the privilege of working
full time, may be warranted in certain trades, but it is
highly desirable that the field of occupation should be
differentiated, and that occupations such as the textile
trades, which involve special strain upon the physique of
growing children, should be regulated by a scale of age.</p>

<p>(6) <i>Extension of the Factory Acts.</i>&mdash;The Acts should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
extended so as to cover the case of laundresses, who ought
never to have been left out. The sanitary conditions under
which vast numbers of these women work are extremely
bad, the hours of work are excessively long and far above
the standard set by the Factory Acts, and in steam laundries
there is a quantity of machinery used without any safeguards
being adopted for proper fencing, so that accidents
are very frequent. The arguments used for keeping laundries
outside the Acts are, that it is a more or less domestic
industry, that any limitation would fall very severely on
the small employer, and that the nature of the trade is
such as to necessitate long working hours during the latter
part of the week, when most of the work is done. Against
this, however, we must set the facts that no attempt has
really been made to organize the work, which could as
well be spread over a longer period as crowded into a
few days each week; that individual employers have
successfully done so; that for the protection of the women
as well as of the public, sanitary supervision is most
essential; and, finally, that the health and safety of those
employed are severely compromised by the conditions
under which work is done at present.</p>

<p>(7) <i>Co-ordination of Local and Imperial Authority.</i>&mdash;Reference
has been made to the difficulties which arise
in the dual control exercised by the Factory Department
and the local sanitary authority, which latter body is responsible
for the sanitary conditions of workshops, subject
to a final reference to the Factory Department. Experience
in past years has proved that when it has been sought in
the same way to devolve upon the local authorities these
important powers, general neglect has been shown by a
large number of districts, so much so indeed, that after
a trial it was found necessary for the Factory Department<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
to resume the work of inspection. This portion of the
Act has in fact been tossed backwards and forwards with
results that can scarcely be called satisfactory. It remains
to be seen whether some plan cannot be adopted by
which the local authorities can be utilised without the
provisions of the Act being allowed to lapse&mdash;a plan
which should be checked by head-quarters either at the
Local Government Board or the Home Office, or by an
executive Labour Department of the future, so that a
given standard of efficiency may be secured. There
remain certain administrative reforms which will no doubt
be carried out as time goes on. Already large additions
have been made to the existing staff of factory inspectors.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>Whilst much of the work is of a more or less routine
and simple character, and can be discharged best by those
who are acquainted with the technicalities and methods of
the trade, there are certain departments which call for the
highest scientific skill, for full statistical information, as
well as for unceasing vigilance. A word or two must be
added as to the penalties which are inflicted under the Acts.
The scale suggested by the Acts is very low, and the magistrates
often inflict a merely nominal penalty, so that employers
who infringe the Acts have little to fear except from
the annoyance caused by proceedings being taken against
them. This is a thoroughly unsatisfactory state of things.</p>

<p>(8) <i>The Truck Act.</i>&mdash;For the protection of women
workers an amendment to the Truck Act is sorely needed;
the system of arbitrary fines and deductions, to which
reference has already been made, is an unmitigated evil,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
and tends more than any other condition of labour to
degrade the workers, and hold them in bondage.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_19" id="Footnote_19"></a><a href="#FNanchor_19"><span class="label">[19]</span></a> The appointment of Departmental Committees, consisting of
scientific specialists and factory inspectors, shews that the Home Office
is alive to the necessity of improving the quality of factory inspection
in the case of injurious trades.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Conclusion.</b>&mdash;During the next few years we are likely
to see great changes, for the agitation which has taken
place in the labour world in recent times is not of a
spasmodic kind. It is the outcome of years of struggle
and suffering and thought, and of many defeats on the
part of the workers. For them the Factory Acts are of
quite incalculable importance. They stand for industrial
health, for the safeguard of the worker’s leisure and
standard of life, for the civic principle in the affairs
of the labour market and the workshop. They stand,
too, for the ratification by the State of the will of the
people as expressed by their common voice and common
organisations. It is not true to say that they spare them the
trouble of doing something which they might equally well
do for themselves. The Acts give a statutory validity to
what the workers have already decided upon in times past.
They secure the ground already won, so that the workers
may go forward, and on that ground raise their standard
of living higher; so that the manufacturers may put
their houses in order, introducing better management and
mechanical methods; so that the standard of living and the
standard of general efficiency may advance together. Under
the guiding intelligence of the nation these great human
enactments, which have been a godsend to the people of
this country in the past, will become ever more fruitful as
higher civic ideals and a deeper conception of human
welfare and industry take the place of the conceptions
which have prevailed during the transition period from
which we are now emerging.</p>

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
